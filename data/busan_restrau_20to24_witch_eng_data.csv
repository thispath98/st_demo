✅ Although the craftsmanship may vary slightly from chain store to chain, the Daegu Soup located next to the Lower Layer Hotel is solid and clean. Frozen cod is used, so it has a good chewy flesh, and most of all, the cool soup and oden are well seasoned and delicious, and a piece of traditional seaweed that looks like it has been thrown in has a nice firm and chewy texture. It's just a hangover and it's so good that you want to come back again.👍🏻

I visited again after almost 6 years, and the interior and taste have not changed.
I don't know if tray noodles are sold separately, but if you order the main menu, tray noodles are provided together.
Please note that if you visit during lunch time, you may not be able to order seafood pancakes and kimchi pancakes.

The reason I visit this restaurant is the radish soybean paste soup. The radish soybean paste soup at other restaurants is sometimes very thick or spicy, but the radish soybean paste soup at Halmae Bossam is just the right amount of seasoning.
Thanks to that, it is a restaurant that comes to mind when you think of radish soybean paste soup. Should I say that it is clean and there are no soybeans or anything like that on the bottom?
If you ask for a refill of soup, they will serve you a large bowl with a ladle in it.
In the case of garlic, if you request a refill, they provide a lot of it.

I ordered the jokbo set, but it came out later than the baekban that I ordered later at another table, probably because the pig's feet were heated before serving.
The bossam and pig's feet were clean without any spicy smell, the radish kimchi was sweet, and the cabbage kimchi had a refreshing taste.
It is said that an additional fee is charged for refilling kimchi.

Actually, the problem with this restaurant is that the tray noodles included in the menu are served a long time later, but it feels like it took 15 minutes.
In the case of the tray noodles, the tangy taste of the mustard was very strong, and the sweet and sour taste went well with the greasy meat.

I wish the noodles came out a little faster, but I can soothe my disappointment by eating some seaweed soup while the noodles come out, so I guess - + 0.

Monagi is a restaurant that is not special.
Willing to visit again in the future
I forgot about it for a while, but when I went back, it was still delicious. It was the same as before.
I'm still thankful that Bossam Set Meal (lunch special) is only 8,000 won. Soft bossam ^^;;
I remember that the lunch special was cheap when I went there in the early 90's. I heard that they set the price so that the elderly people in the area could come and enjoy bossam and a glass of takju without burden, and it seems that they still do that.
Next time I go nearby, I'll definitely stop by.
When I went this time, the price for bossam set meal had been increased to ₩7,000. Still, it is a good value for money place.
Long history, simple but bossam... deep taste of cabbage soybean paste soup... it's full of seniors in the evening.
Bossam set menu is cheap and delicious! 🤤Sari set menu is also delicious!🤗Bossam set menu and Sari set meal are served from 11 am to 3 pm!🙂 Pig's feet are also available!😀You can eat it while sitting on a chair!😀
Let's go have a cup of coffee.

Overall, Chungdam is a great restaurant that I highly recommend.
A very nice experience here. For me it was the first time eating Kbbq so certainly a unique and fun experience. I enjoyed the meats they had as well as all the delicious spicy sauces too. I would recommend the grill for anyone who goes there as well as the octopus! Great food. Will certainly return in the future. The only disappointment is the mall itself where it’s located. Other than that great time.
Nested deep inside the mall, chungdam is a little difficult to find but a treat for your palate. The seafood soup was beyond amazing, with handmade noodles and all sorts of seafood in it. They served delicious sides with the soup. Place serves soju as well so a perfect date spot.
Looking for a good Korean place in Gurgaon with that authentic vibe, this is the perfect place. Good location, great food and very friendly staff. Do visit this place!!
Chungdam @ Global Foyer Mall at Golf Course Gurgaon is one of the top Korean restaurants in Gurgaon. Their portions are good and their Bibimbap is one of the most loved items in my family. They have private rooms dining experience at their restaurant.

I ordered fried dumplings 🥟 (7000 Won) and boiled dumplings 🥟 (7000 wons). Some sides were provided (radish, kimchi, cucumber). The fried dumplings with the soy sauce and garlic were delicious. Amazing taste between crispy, sweet and the power of the garlic. I loved this fried dumplings. The boiled dumplings were not really bad but no taste, it was flat. Fortunately, i had the sauce.

The aunts were so kind and the food was so delicious.
There is no particular parking lot, but you can park two cars in front of the store.
The soup is very steamy and the meat is plentiful and soft.

It was also the best value for money.
I went to the main branch thinking it would be a good restaurant worthy of a chain branch, but it wasn't as good as I thought.
1. Insufficient bone mass. At least 3 to 4 pieces is standard, but 2 pieces...ㅇㅇ..
2. The amount of rice was not enough. Let's do it in moderation...
3. The amount of soup is not enough.
4. The taste is so-so...?
There is parking space in front of the building for at most two cars. Just an ordinary house.

★★★☆☆: No intention of revisiting, just so-so
★★★★☆: A house that is overall good but lacks cost-effectiveness, lacks service, or leaves something to be desired.
★★★★★: There is nothing to criticize, this is the house you want to go to if someone from out of town comes to visit.
I had steamed seafood backbone.

It was a sweet and spicy seasoning that seemed to be made of starch and red pepper powder.

Both seafood and bones were delicious. The bean sprouts were also okay.

There were many other meal menus, so it seemed like they put a lot of effort into the side dishes and they were quite delicious.

The soup looked like gamjatang soup on the outside, but it had a lot of cinnamon flavor and was just okay.

The rice had a bit of black rice mixed in, but I was a bit disappointed that only two-thirds of it was in the air.

Overall, in terms of taste, it's excellent, so 5 stars.

It said there was a discount for student taxi drivers.

They said you could park on the public road next to the store during meal times, but I did because there was an empty parking lot in the back.
This restaurant only uses the backbone, which is a by-product of the pork that is slaughtered on the same day. Since I deliver it, I guarantee the taste and sincerity.

Since the rice is polished on the same day and then cooked using a pressure cooker with different grades of rice, the bapbat is chewy, sticky, and savory.
The main side dish menu is decent enough to eat. Reservation is required during peak hours.
The price is reasonable, the taste is good, and the side dishes are all delicious. The price of meat was also cheap.
But the space between tables is very narrow. It's just as bad if both are sitting. I wish there was a little more space to pass by.
And it's really, really loud. It's completely market-related. It seems like a lot of guys come and talk too loudly. It's hard to hear the voices of people sitting at the same table.
The staff are friendly, but because there are a lot of customers, there are times when the requested items are not delivered and are often delivered very late. It's easier to say it several times or just take it to the kitchen.

I hope wasabi is not added to salmon sushi so that children can eat it too.
Well, first of all, the grains of rice are okay, the variety is average, and the freshness is okay, but the rice vinegar is a bit sour, so I get sick of it before I eat about 10 plates.
I've been to at least 50 conveyor belt sushi restaurants across the country and ate more than 20 plates in total, but this was the first time I ate 13 plates.
I wish they re-seasoned the candle water.
I visited Yeonsan-dong because it had good reviews, and compared to xx Tour, which is a popular conveyor belt sushi restaurant in Busan these days, the menu was small, but each menu tasted better.

I liked that the seasoning and sauce taste was not as strong as the usual conveyor belt sushi restaurants, and the soup was mild for my taste, but those who like strong flavors may like it or not.

I ordered udon and buckwheat noodles because they were on the recommended menu at the store. The broth was seasoned just right and the quantity was great for the price.

2,500 won per plate, a decent enough place for conveyor belt sushi.

It was nice that the noodles weren't udon noodles so they didn't swell while eating.
It's a sushi restaurant close to my house and the prices aren't expensive, but the sushi rice is so soft that it falls apart when you pick it up with chopsticks.
The taste is pretty good.

As it is a Japanese course meal, it is nice to be able to taste a variety of dishes at once. I am also very satisfied with the friendly service and response from the staff! It was a place where you could feel the authentic taste of an old restaurant in every single piece of raw fish. There are also many spacious spaces for group gatherings. Since it was a private room, I was able to eat properly in a private space!👍
There is a parking lot and a manager, so parking is convenient and the location is also good.
I had a 60,000 won course, and since it was Japanese food, it couldn't have been more delicious.
I intend to visit again~
It's a weekend evening, so it's a more expensive place than average.
I ate everything and it was delicious. The parking space right in front of the store is small. There is also a parking lot nearby. The lobster soup served as the last course is the delicacy of this restaurant.

Clean and refreshing bean sprout soup. Siruhyanggi Yuseong Branch is an old house, so I like it because the taste doesn’t change even if I visit it occasionally.
It's very filling as a hangover or as a meal.
Regular bean sprout soup costs 8,000 won. It comes in mild/normal/spicy flavors! The warmed soup is served in a cooling(?) bowl rather than an earthenware pot, so even those who are not good at eating hot soup can enjoy it! Cauldron rice is also really delicious.
I ate separate soup (bean sprout soup + pot rice)!
I think the side dishes that came with it are delicious and good for hangovers 🤔

I intend to visit again 😋👍

It's a bit difficult to find since it's inside the market. The store is neatly organized and the soup is good. I wish it was a little thicker.
The buckwheat noodles did not have the harsh taste of makguksu and had almost no scent. The potato pancake was soft and delicious, and the radish kimchi that came with it was excellent.
A place I often visit in the alley in the market near my house.

The aroma and taste of buckwheat is faint and the seasoning is too sweet.
The dumplings are satisfying and the buckwheat tea that you can pour yourself is excellent.

It's totally fine. Of course, it is difficult to know whether vegetables are recycled or not, but the vegetables that are laid down always retain moisture. And a moderate amount of meat and a lot of vegetables. I think this concept is really good for having a healthy lunch for only 14,000 won.

I had a delicious meal ^^
Delicious!
The side dishes are just so-so lol, but since the main menu is steamed food, the steamed food is really delicious.
The taste of monkfish stew is the same as before.
I ordered 80,000 won of boiled monkfish pork, but the liver was also missing... I wonder if I'm blind...

The raw fish soup was also delicious.

Mansutang is okay. It seems bland at first, but the seasoning adjusts as it cools.

The meat pancake is a little sweet, but it’s edible when eaten with green onion (I don’t like meat pancake in the first place...).
The side dishes are also neat. I didn't like the kimchi, but the lotus root was so delicious that I ate it twice more. (self)
There are many types of food, so I think even families can eat well.
If it were closer to home, I would go often. (It's a bit far...)
You have to go by 11 o'clock to eat comfortably.
After about 30 minutes, there was a waiting line.
Everyone is coming to eat galbitang. The crispy bulgogi was too sweet. There are so many customers.
I ate rib soup, mansu soup(?), and meat pancake.
The galbitang is reasonably delicious and includes glass noodles and 4 ribs. The land battle was also okay. Mansutang has quite a strong mushroom flavor.

As expected, the food is poor for the price--I had the special for 4 people---I think it's too much--Only the last noodle soup is Han River---It's a shame, the restaurant owner thinks it's hot--The raw fish is really good--I decided after looking at the pictures. do--

Randomly walked by the restaurant and really surprised by the pork soup here. The staff is really friendly and helpful, one of them taught us how to mix the paste in the soup and wrap the pork in local way. Highlight recommended.

You might be surprised that you will get scissors on your table. This unusual utensil is intended to be used straight from the beginning to cut the pile of noodles in half.

Now to the review. After you find the restaurant (backstreet behind main street), you might be surprised that there are only 3 items on menu. We ordered all 3. There are dumplings, noodles in frozen water and cold noodles without any liquid. Dumplings we really liked. Cold noodles are really tasty and interesting experience. I am happy that I tried it, but I think I am staying with Korean barbecue as my favourite dish. If you go to try the cold noodles for the first time, I suggest to order small portion. We had big one, and it was too much. What I actually liked most, was warm broth served for free (probably to revive your frozen mouth). I give five stars because all was great and tasty,  the problem is in me, it is just not my cup of broth ...
Try the cold noodles, a better option.
First time trying milmyeon and was not disappointed.
Great for lunch, inexpensive and the servers are lovely.

The noodles were soft but chewy and the broth was savoury but sweet at the same time. The mandu was also delicious with the housemade sauce. The pot they serve instead of water is actually the meat broth that the noodles come in and is delicious too.
Food and service was good! Not much English spoken, but the lady was kind and patient in explaining how I should approach the meal. I ordered the noodles one with ice and mandu, which was delicious but the ice did give me a slight brain freeze. This was solved with the warm tea/soup drink they provided. I came here alone, noodles+mandu was a bit much but I still managed to finish the meal.
The 밀면 is pretty good here and the serving size is huge. Lot of people eat here. It was crowded.

The meat itself has a good color and is fresh. There is no need to use scissors as it is cut into pieces.

However, I ordered a total of 4 plates for 5 people each, and there was a slight difference in meat quality from each plate.

I think it would be good for a company dinner as there is a room.
A place where you can eat a variety of foods like a buffet. It says it's a rib restaurant, but the ribs were very sweet. It was difficult to find a separate parking lot, but the place was friendly.
There aren't many side dishes, but each one is substantial.

I visited for the first time in ten years and had a delicious meal.
As expected, goat meat is more delicious than duck. It is good to eat as a delicacy sometimes.
But goats are very expensive~~
The male boss is kind~
Charcoal-grilled goat + white-boiled pork with oriental medicine takes an hour to cook, so we recommend ordering in advance on weekends.  I think you can eat the goat meat first and then the boiled white meat. The goat meat costs 40,000 won per serving and boiled boiled rice costs 40,000 won per serving. It's delicious. The parking lot is small, so you may want to use the public parking lot nearby.  After eating, it would be nice to go to the nearby Hwamyeong Ecological Park.
The food is delicious, but they are very unfriendly and they don't respond to questions I ask and speak informally. I went to eat the food in a good mood, but my mood actually gets worse.
Duck meat is delicious. The interior is spacious... and the bus is right in front...

It's delicious, and the crab served as a side dish is also delicious. There's a parking lot next to the police box across the street.

It’s been a while since I tasted it 💗
Never touch the food before it comes out.
I'm going to eat rice slowly now haha.
Please keep in mind that this is for taste.
Anyway, it tasted even better because it’s been a while since I ate it. “ㅁ”
After all, Busan food...
It's sweet
I ordered domestic lamb tripe casserole and it was sweet.
I ordered it because I wanted a refreshing, clean, and spicy taste, and the price was 39,000 won.
Overall, it's okay as long as it's not too sweet.
Even the friendly owner...
There is also a playroom, so those with children can enjoy their meals comfortably.
Both shrimp and octopus are plump and spicy octopus casserole style. The bowl of rice is separate so you have to order it separately!
Side dishes include kimchi, seaweed, bean sprouts, seasoned crab, cold seaweed soup, and salad.
There are so many delicious basic side dishes!
Refilling the crab is a must!!

The chewy octopus and savory shrimp that chew every time you eat them are absolutely delicious!

There are about 12 tables for 4 people and the turnover rate is fast! It cooks quickly and the average meal time is 20 or 30 minutes? I think that’s about it🩷

Willing to visit again!!🧚🏻‍♀️
I like Nakgobsae, so I often get takeout and eat it at the store, and it's delicious.

Even though I ate the seasoning, it tasted neither this nor that, it was boring..
There is no need to come all the way here as the taste can be enjoyed anywhere.
It was nice to have a system where employees take turns checking the grill from time to time without a dedicated table staff member.
When my friends come to Yongin, I always take them here. They say it's absolutely delicious. It's especially light because it's baked on a stone plate, and it's fun to watch when it's cooked in front of you.
The final highlight here is the cheese scorched rice.
A good roast duck restaurant. A good restaurant to take your parents to. They don't provide half and half of the seasoning and salt, so it would be better for a large number of people to go and order one duck at a time.
A non-greasy roast duck loin restaurant
There's a line at the house even at 11 o'clock

Thank you for serving delicious and thoughtful food.
I feel very healthy when I eat here.
The side dishes are the same, and most of all, I am satisfied with the freshness and health of the shellfish itself.
The set menu is good, and the shabu-shabu is also worth a try. After the shabu-shabu, the udon noodles are chewy and delicious, and the porridge is also very tasty, so I recommend it.

The taste is good compared to the price. The shine of the meat is somewhat weak. Of course, the meat of the flower cannot be tasteless and the meat of the ribs is very poor. The price is 30,000 won per 100 grams. hmm
This is the best restaurant in Busan.
That's why they provide oxygenated water, which is great (helps eliminate hangovers and improves digestion)
Although the price is a little high, it is the best beef restaurant around here.

There was a marker.

There is an entrance and exit road to National Highway 4.

This is a little to mid size Japanese restaurant with some tables in the front and some rooms in the back.  Our group had nigiri (raw fish) sushi, sashimi with vinegrette and negitoro (scraped & minced tuna meat) with sea urchin.  All foods were  well presented and delicious.  Of course, good food needs a company.  I had Suntory highball which smoothly cooled me down.  (It's 90F and humid outside...)

Great Futomaki and Yookhwi (raw beef) tartar, nice small rooms that are safe and cozy.

In town. Price sounds expensive but it is very reasonable considering what you get. Very much recommended
The appetizer bites at the beginning made for a very strong start to the meal. However, the rest of the meal, while very good, did not provide much surprise in terms of taste and creativity, until the desserts, which were excellent. Service was on point as expected from a two starred restaurant. For the price point, I expected a little more spark, as is usually the case for this level of restaurant.
Food was tasty and beautiful. Korean ingredients, made with love and care in both eastern and western cooking techniques. Service also impeccable, did the 7-glasses wine pairing. And the wine pour was very decent. Most of the times the wine pairing portion is always pitifully small - but not here! The pour was big! Also celebrated birthday here. They gave a complementary seaweed rice (a play on the seaweed soup that is traditionally served for Korean birthdays). Very thoughtful and special.
The food is fresh and delicious, the taste is quite safe for a 2-star Michelin. The service is sometimes clumsy, I recommend you to retrain them on how to serve (for example, need to put dishes on the table for diners at the same time, or at least serve the dishes for lady first, that is the Michelin standard I have experienced). The space is quite cozy. Hopefully the chef will come up with an impressive menu next time.
While the price for a 2 Michelin star restaurant was very reasonable, the dishes were not as impressive as we had anticipated. They had plenty of premium ingredients, but the truly impressive courses were the dessert courses. Nonetheless, this was still a very satisfying meal, and they were very detailed when asking about dietary restrictions. Service was on point, as expected.

There was one menu item I didn't like and it was very fishy. I didn't ask what it was.

It was perfect down to the last drop.
A long-established restaurant with great value for money.
If you order raw fish for 30,000 won per person, you will receive enough raw fish and side dishes to fill an adult man.

The sashimi is also chewy and substantial. I was so moved by the continued serving of fried food, seaweed maki, and stew...
The next team dinner is here!!!
I heard that this is a restaurant where you have to walk to get in but crawl to get out, so I went for dinner.

There are many Seopguk restaurants around Sol Beach, but everyone recommends Seopjeon at this restaurant. I think that's why it doesn't feel greasy and is crispy yet hearty.
They say there is a lot of waiting on the weekends, but maybe because it was 12 o'clock on a Saturday, we didn't have to wait for a seat and ate right away.
Stopped by for breakfast after staying at Yangyang Sol Beach
Open from 9 a.m., this is a place where you can taste Seop, Yangyang’s representative food. I ordered and ate soup for breakfast and it was delicious. He served us a side dish that he made himself and asked if the kimchi was sour. He said he was worried that the kimchi he made was too sour. He also shared warm words with us. All the side dishes were delicious and I felt good. There is a lot of soup, so I am satisfied with my meal. It's not all that filling, but it's still a lot! Next time I want to try Seoppajeon.. You can do it in front of the parking lot. Seopguk 12,000 won, Seopkalguksu 9,000 won, Seoppajeon 18,000 won... The prices are a bit expensive!
But I think it's worth the sea view haha.
The sea view, Jangkalguksu, and red pepper paste soup were unusual. Overall, it was good because it wasn't too salty and the seasoning was just right. Cockle Bibimbap The bibim sticks to your mouth so well that it makes you want to come back to eat it again. This is a delicious restaurant that you can't find anywhere in Seoul. For makgeolli, I recommend raw makgeolli. I think there was only one type. It was so nice that the five of us could go and eat evenly.
The lines were long on the weekends, so I went for brunch on a weekday and was able to get in with plenty of time. The noodle soup and crispy noodle pancakes were really delicious. Be sure to try it, and as a bonus, you could enjoy the winter seascape.
Seoppajeon Recommendation
It's crispy and moist, and the mussels aren't fishy, ​​so they're delicious.
Jangkalguksu also has a spicy and rich broth.
Personally, I don't like red pepper paste kalguksu, but I enjoyed it.

I was curious about what was so complicated about parking during lunch on a weekday.

First of all, the reason it’s so popular is
the price is reasonable
You can’t just eat simple soft tofu stew.
Like a small salad bar, you can eat your own side dishes.

There are duruchigi, japchae, tteokbokki, bean curd, etc.
There are delicious foods beyond the main menu.

If you visit during lunch time, be prepared to wait.
There is a private parking lot, but parking is not easy.
If you only think about cost-effectiveness, it can be said to be a very good place! The staff are friendly and the food is delicious. However, it is salty overall. I couldn't eat many of the unlimited refills because the side dishes were salty even for my salty palate. (I craved a lot of water after eating) As of 11:20 a.m. on a weekday, it was very difficult to park (you can still park your car). There was a bit of waiting.

=====================
The price rose by 1,000 won.
The side dishes have been stabilized.
Self-serve side dishes... Tteokbokki is served as a side dish.
My child liked it...
I visited for lunch...
I came here with a friend and it was healthy and delicious.
I had to wait to visit during lunch time... The stir-fried bulgogi was delicious. All the other side dishes were good, but the seaweed cold soup was not tasty.
There is a large parking lot, but it is helpful to go without a car.
This is a soft tofu a la carte restaurant. Its popularity is enormous. I always take my turn and wait before entering;;; It was so uncomfortable that I wondered how delicious it was.

Soft tofu stew is not bad. As the word ‘millstone’ appears on the sign, it is made using tofu manufactured directly here. I feel like I'm eating something healthy? Haha.

The unique feature of this place is that you can eat your own side dishes. You are supposed to eat as much as you want on a small plate, but these side dishes are in a very strange condition.
I'm sorry to say that it tastes good, but it doesn't taste good;;
It's not just that the seasoning is right or wrong.
Food ingredients are all bought up. It looks like it's been given to me somewhere else, but it's deflated, limp, dry, and twisted.
I was surprised that the Duruchigi (?) pork I ate that day was so dry and hard that it was as crispy as a cookie. It's amazing that they offer something like this to people to eat, and it's also amazing that people line up to say that this place is a good restaurant.
The price for the basic soft tofu jjajjigae is 7,500 won.
I don't want to eat food that looks like it's been processed out of stock;;;
A store full of old men. You can easily think of it as a Korean buffet restaurant. It's a taste that can't compete with soft tofu stew. However, the side dishes are varied enough and taste good. Stir-fried meat is a popular menu item because of its fiery taste, and tteokbokki is also spicy and a hit. The japchae is so so, the okara, kimchi, and bean sprouts are also edible. That's why there are so many uncles. Aren’t these all snacks for drinks? There are a lot of people who drink alcohol... The problem is that the stew is so so!!
However, since there were so many side dishes, I thought I was just at a Korean buffet restaurant and it became worth it.

★★★☆☆: No intention of revisiting, just so-so
★★★★☆: The house is overall good, but the cost-effectiveness is poor, the service is lacking, or something is a little disappointing. I need to visit again and check again.
★★★★★: There is nothing to criticize, this is the house you want to go to if someone from out of town comes to visit.

Every time I go to Busan, the CEO of a Busan company buys me dinner. He took me here once before and I liked it so much that I insisted on going there this time on my business trip to Busan.
It was a bit out of the way so some people rejected it haha.
The CEO is a regular, so he greets everyone as he goes in... It turns out that there are two golf courses next to it, so it's a place where a lot of people go to play golf on the weekend.

The ribs are not super delicious or anything, but they are in perfect condition for cooking and eating. The side dishes are also decent.
And, here... you have to ask for red pepper paste. Otherwise, they won't give it to you. It's like stir-fried red pepper paste, but it tastes great when dipped in meat.
They always serve raw meat as a service, but I don't know if they give it all.
Salt is always on the table, so if you like salt, just scoop it up and eat it.

I always eat scorched rice for dessert, and it’s delicious.

Great location, right in front of Shinyongsan Station!
The store is smaller than expected, so there may be a wait.
The menus were visually pretty, delicious, and okay.
It's ordinary. It was difficult to feel the charm of raw noodles. I said the potato gnocchi was delicious, but I didn't find it to be anything special. The sound of dishes being washed echoed throughout the hall, which was louder than expected.
The store is a little small, but the food was delicious!
The gnocchi was especially delicious. I thought it had a slightly hard texture, but the potato to cheese ratio was good 👍
The pasta was unique because it was fresh pasta, and I liked it because it went well with the ingredients. (I think it was pasta with prosciutto and arugula, but I forget the name)
I originally wanted to order cannelloni made with tomato sauce, but I couldn't because it was sold in limited quantities. It was a bit greasy for my taste, but I enjoyed it with a glass of wine and it felt refreshing.
Representative menu items include gnocchi, cannelloni, and Iberico oil. The gnocchi did not suit my taste as much as I expected. I enjoyed the cannelloni and iberico oil.
It's small inside, so it's perfect for two people.

I went with my kids. It's a very famous house~~^^
The side dishes are also neat and delicious.
Visit three or four times a year for family gatherings. The meat quality is not bad. Normally it's okay, but on weekends or when there are a lot of customers, the service gets overloaded.
It reminds me of the coziness of eating at a go-go restaurant with my parents in the 90s.

Raw ribs recommended

The raw ribs come prepared and still attached to the bone... that is, in a form that can be rolled up (very satisfied).

It's a bit pricey, but it's worth staying on a nice day.

Valet parking too.
The seasoned ribs are thin but slightly chewy... chewy... as good as they are old...
The raw ribs are melting... delicious...

Since it has been moved to a new location, it doesn't have the same old feel as before, but it's still clean and the ribs still taste good.

There are fewer places to eat delicious pork ribs than I thought, so sometimes when I want to eat ribs, I go there without hesitation.

The wait was long when it was originally in the alley, but you can still eat right away at the new location, but I don't know how long it will last.

Pork ribs and stew are delicious, and various vegetables and basic side dishes are also delicious. Although it is not a special menu, it is a food that is deeply entrenched in daily life, so even before Seongsu-dong became prosperous, local residents who have been frequenting it even though it is crowded and lined up like it is now. It feels like I'm eating it even after taking the risk.

Even if Seongsu-dong's boom moves to other places, Daeseong Galbi will likely remain steady.
In front of Ttukseom subway - parking is available in the basement of the Seoul Forest A Tower building, the staff is very friendly, and the pork ribs are delicious. The kimchi stew that comes with rice is also hearty as it contains a lot of pork.
A pork rib restaurant that moved from Seoul Forest Galbi Alley
It's so nice to have a clean and catch table after the move. It was difficult before because I had to guard the front of the store🥲
Pork ribs are delicious, but the taste of pork ribs comes out even better when you eat it with the kimchi stew that is provided, so grill the meat slowly and be sure to eat it with the kimchi stew!
Many people visit the pork rib restaurant near Ttukseom Station. But the cost-effectiveness is small. Service is friendly.
It's consistently delicious and good value for money. It is close to exits 5 and 6 of Ttukseom Station, and it is newly decorated and has a good atmosphere.

Food is very good. The duck meat is delicious and all the side dishes are also delicious. Among them, the homemade soybean paste instead of ssamjang is the best. Soybean paste stew made with homemade soybean paste is also sold separately and is a must-try.
The stone plate is really big so you can grill all the meat at once, which is very convenient and nice. The meat tastes too bad. Both seasonings are very delicious. Aged kimchi is also delicious.

It is so famous that it needs no introduction.
I ate oriental medicine chicken soup. I heard it’s a double impression.
The three of us ate our fill and walked to the Sanseong Tunnel entrance stop.
After coming here, I understand why the rating here is low.
First of all, the food is not prepared, the service is not done properly, and the food is very poor compared to the price range. It is absolutely the worst. And the parking lot is limited to parking for 3 cars. If you want to park, you have to park on the street.
The food is really delicious! Lotus leaf rice, hot pot, duck meat, side dishes, etc. are all delicious!  Even the air rice is delicious. But that's it.
The service is terrible and it's a great place to spend a lot of money and feel bad. Serves 12 people in one pot. When I asked for one more cup, he said he couldn't give me more because he had already used all 12, and even seemed to notice that he was adding a side dish. I feel like I'm saving on dishes and cups. I guess washing dishes is a hassle. I hope no one wastes their money after reading this post. It seems like a restaurant with the mindset that it only needs to taste good.
It was spacious and had three floors, so it was comfortable to eat. Because it was the weekend, I ate the 19,000 won lotus leaf rice set meal, but the taste was bland and boring. Even as someone who likes light flavors, it wasn't too tasty. What I liked the most was the tofu stew with tofu. I haven't tried mushroom sweet and sour pork, so I don't know, and it's hard to get to unless you have a car, so I'm subtracting one star.

The quality of the meat is very good and it is convenient to cook the meat yourself. In the case of expensive special parts, quantities are limited, so quick orders are required.

The biggest drawback is probably the price. It was 72,000 won for 160g of shrimp meat, but it really came down to those two pieces.
Still, the meat quality is good.

Yukhoe is served without eggs or sliced ​​pears.

Gyeonghuigung is the only free palace of the five. It translates to the Palace of Serene Harmony. It was built on the slopes of Mount Inwangsam in 1616, such that it harmonizes well with the landscape.

It is the smallest of the five and served as the secondary palace, used in emergencies or if Gyeongbokgung or Chandeokgung Palace were under repair. Destroyed during the Japanese occupation during WWII, its restoration began in the 1990s.

The main hall is called Sungjeongjeon.

It's usually not too crowded, which is always a plus!

Note that another entrance/exit is close to the Bomb Shelter.
What makes this palace special is its lesser-known status compared to other grand palaces, allowing you to explore its grounds in relative quiet and tranquility.

As a secondary palace, Gyeonghuigung served as a refuge for Joseon kings during times of crisis, providing a sense of strategic safety and retreat. This historical significance gives the palace an intriguing backstory that adds depth to your visit.

One of the highlights is its peaceful ambiance. With fewer visitors compared to the larger palaces, you can enjoy a more intimate experience, taking your time to absorb the atmosphere and marvel at the historical structures around you.
This place is worth visiting when you’re in the neighborhood. No entrance required and it was very quiet at the time I visited (on a Friday afternoon).
When you’re there, make sure to go to the very back, where you can find a rock formation. A local told us it brings good luck when you have your picture taken when you’re standing on the rock :-)

Please respond with a ❤️if this review was helpful to you. Thanks!
It's palace. Nice place to take a walk. Not so many people were visiting.

Looking at the soup alone, the soup poured into the hotpot and the soups on the separate menu items like Doganitang and Tail Gomtang are of poor quality. This was different. The soup in the a la carte menu was much whiter and richer, so be sure to try both the a la carte and the hotpot.
The food comes out within a few minutes after ordering👍
The soup is very rich. The lamb inside is also delicious!
Especially the kimchi is really delicious👍👍

Plus, parking is easy and the staff are all friendly. Since the menu is a menu, the people looking for it are generally of a certain age group.
A place I stop by when I feel like loach stew
Best when you want hot soup
Chueotang is delicious and the side dishes are healthy and taste like homemade side dishes.
There is a room for many meetings, and there are both sitting and standing tables, so it is convenient. The store is well managed and clean.
The male owner’s cooking skills are good.
The middle-aged woman serving lacks professionalism.

We got here after a trip to the museums in the area due to a sign outside that had a special offer. We went inside wanting to take said offer but there was some problem (we didn't understand) and sadly couldn't take it.

Glancing over the menu we felt that the prices were a little higher than comparable restaurants in the area we lived in but went with some pork belly and soup.
It was just an ordinary restaurant, and I had flounder seaweed soup and broiler sauce. Both tasted good, but the amount of soup was too much for one person to eat, and it was a waste to have leftover. In particular, the flounder seaweed soup was tasty because it was based on beef, but it was disappointing that I couldn't taste the flounder at all.
The side dishes served are the usual side dishes.
I recommend going on a day when you want to eat seaweed soup and broiler soup, but it's not a good restaurant.
The gondre namul rice was good too.
If you want to eat here, I think it would be best to just eat flounder seaweed soup.
14,000 won.
It's okay if you just enjoy the seaweed soup, but there were no side dishes.
You may feel that the price is a little expensive, but it is acceptable when you look at the contents of the food. The variety of basic side dishes is not wide, but the presentation is neat and the taste is good. If we take Korean food as a standard, it can be said to be of above average quality. However, the price is a bit high for one meal, so I don't think I can go often, and I recommend bringing an adult with you if possible. And free parking is available, so you can park comfortably.
I visited this restaurant because it was famous for gondre pot rice.
The store is large and has good facilities.
There is also good parking space.

If you look at the menu, seaweed soup seems to be famous too.

The beef here is tasty 😋
The taste is good, but overall the price is expensive. The side dishes were also changed to one refill.
It's not high quality, but there are very few places like this near Pukyong National University, so there are a lot of people.
Galbitang and Gomtang have many meals for lunch.
It's usually for gatherings and beef is expensive.
They say the meat someone else bought is the most delicious, and this is it.
It's a bit expensive and disappointing to go with my own money, but it seems okay to eat with someone else's money (for company dinners, meetings, etc.).
On the menu, tail gomtang and king rib soup seem to be popular.
There are other menus, but they are a bit expensive. lol
I do not recommend buying with my own money.
The price of tail gomtang is 2.5, and the meat is sturdy. I heard about 3 pieces. The kimchi has a slightly ripe taste and is good to eat with salted squid. The crayfish cuisine is a bit weird. Recommended for pampering yourself with hot Korean soup.
When I came down to Busan with my parents, I thought it was a good restaurant and ate there. It was written on the wall that Korean beef bulgogi was 33,000 won per person, but it was 28,000 won for lunch on weekdays and 2+1 for all day on weekends, so I checked with the waiter and ordered this menu. However, the meat that came out wasn't seasoned, the texture was like paper porridge, and the amount wasn't even enough for 3 people. And when I checked it out later, it was calculated as 33,000 won. I was embarrassed and asked, and they said it was this price on the weekend. Then, what did it say on the flyer? Isn't it completely designed to attract customers?
All I could think was that I was hooked. The meat was delicious. I don't write reviews like this, but the service from the cashier was like, ""Why should I take something for granted?"" and I felt really bad. I tried to treat my parents to a delicious lunch, but I was really upset and irritated. Usually, I don't write reviews. It's really rubbish here.

The taste is beyond basic. Satisfied with the kindness and quantity. As with the previous house, there is a sense of having a slow village and horizon. The price will increase by 1,000 won from June 2022. Still, an acceptable price

There is no separate parking lot and the soybean paste stew is the only restaurant.
It was the most tasteless soybean paste stew I've ever had in my life... It's amazing how they can make it so tasteless even though it contains meat... haha.
But they sell such soybean paste stew for 3,000 won.
Amazing...
I ate beef bibimbap and braised ribs for lunch.
The beef bibimbap was delicious, but the galbi stew felt a bit lacking in quantity. After the meal, you can have coffee and Schisandra chinensis tea as dessert, and I liked that Schisandra chinensis tea was strong and refreshing.
Yukhoe bibimbap changed to stone pot bibimbap.

If you're a tourist, you can't use a credit card, no appetizers, no noodle refill even if you pay.

We had a terrible experience due to poor service. The lady in the picture refused to serve appetizers unless we ordered more food, which is not typical of Korean cuisine. Additionally, she wouldn’t refill our noodles, claiming only one refill per chicken pot was allowed. By the way, we had to pay for the noodles. When we left, they refused to take my credit card and asked us to go out to get cash. I am surprised by the bad service as the restaurant was only half full, or maybe that is the reason why it is not filled.

Last Christmas, the service was excellent. They served appetizers and refilled noodles without any issues. Today, however, the waitress was a disgrace to the restaurant, leaving us with a terrible impression as tourists.

My family came all the way expecting to eat the nice noodles we had back at Christmas last year but were absolutely disappointed.

This meal was an absolute waste of time and the worst part of our Seoul trip.

My only advice: avoid this restaurant if u are tourist unless you want to pay cash, enjoy no appetizers, and receive bad service.
The food is amazing and I love it. Also the service is amazing and lovely
Delicious food, reasonable price, and excellent service! the waitresses are super kind and helpful. no line ups and mainly local customers. would recommend friends and families to come as well 👍
Just wonderful and surprise chicken 🐔 and soup 🍜 .. come and try for “Chiken hot pot”..
It tastes similar to a chicken of Dongdaemun.

I had steamed monkfish. There were only a few side dishes: cabbage salad (I used it because it wasn't soaked in water), stewed nuts, kimchi, and seaweed? This is all the same seaweed.
The steamed monkfish tastes normal, but the first taste was too bland as I ate it.
It tastes slightly spicy, but it's still bland.
Especially Agu is so naughty. I ordered potato salad but didn't eat it.
It says sikhye is self-serve, but they put a bottle in it.
The taste was a bit sweet so it was good to eat.
The taste is a bit boring, but the side dishes are usually satisfactory with sikhye.

So today I recommended this restaurant to my family who came visit Seoul from Taiwan. Unfortunately the Chinese waitress who served us was very rude. She helped cooked the beef. After she finished, she told us to pay her tip directly. I was so shocked to hear that. It's also my first time to hear that after living in Korea for 10 years. Later I requested her to give us new side dishes. She said we have to order more beef if we want more side dishes because this restaurant is ""high-class"". I've never heard such thing in Korea. Obviously she just wanted to cheat us because she thought we were all tourists. I was outraged and complained to the restaurant owner and manager. They apologized and offered us two bottles of soda drinks. I am very disappointed and regret to come here with my family tonight. I don't think I will come here again. This kind of bad attitude and poor service should not happen in this restaurant.
Excellent quality of beef and the side dishes were very generous. Fresh salads as side dishes. Very good customer service. One of our favorites. (For those who posted bad reviews and complained about being put into a private room and forced to order more, the restaurant staff asks you in advance if you’re having bbq. If not and you’re ordering the basic 1-person sets, you’ll be sitting outside in the main area. Once you’re in the room, it’s obvious you’ll be ordering more than 1 portion of beef per person because each portion is only around 250 grams. They have smaller 100 gram portions on the menu but even my kids eat more than that. So it’s obvious you’ll order more and given how generous the side dish portions are, which are all included in the price, you’ll be ordering more beef. We have 2 adults and 2 tweens/teens in our family and we ordered 4 portions of various cuts of beef plus beef tartare and beef rib soup. With the side dishes, it was just enough. Really good quality of beef and service as the staff cook and serve the beef for you as it cooks so incredibly fast over the hot charcoal!)
Terrible service. So-so food. We were told we must order one dish per person but the portions were large so we wasted food. If you're not ravenous, get more soups than the noodles or rice dishes.
Some of the best food I have ever eaten.  Service was great, meat melts in your mouth, side dishes were large and plentiful.  We went twice in two days as you need a reservation for certain types of meat.  Would go again.
Very bad experience. We were first asked if we wanted bbq when we entered which we did. We were brought into a private room and that’s when they started pressurizing us to order the more expensive beef, stating that they’d only serve if we order at least 3-4 portions of beef. Since we were already in their private room, we were pressured to order the meat and when she served us the more expensive meat, she was so unhappy and upset that she threw and slapped the meat down on the grill and said, “There, your 1 portion of this.” Horrible service and was really an unenjoyable meal. The hot stone bibimbap was moist instead of having the char at the end. Will not recommend

The atmosphere was like a no frills locals cafe. We received complimentary barley coffee.
It was our last night in Seoul and we were craving something that would soothe our insides before a long journey back home. This restaurant did not disappoint!

We ordered the Abalone Porridge (the E version) and it came with kimchi, some marinated squid? (Offered a wonderful texture) and bean sprouts. The meals also came with a cold kimchi soup with radishes that helps aid with digestion (we drank this last).

The service was wonderful! We went around 5PM (17:00). The last order is taken at 18:40.  We paid 18,000 Won for each meal
Every spoonful of Songjuk Porridge is a journey of flavors, a perfect harmony of ingredients that soothe the soul and tantalize the taste buds. Whether enjoyed on a chilly day or as a heartwarming comfort meal, its simplicity belies its incredible depth of flavor. A culinary masterpiece that never fails to delight!
No words to describe what we just ate. The food here is the purest form of Korean soul. Reminded me of my late grandmothers breakfast we so enjoyed eating together. The ladies that work here are so kind, generous and warming. This restaurant has been owned by the same family for 56years with the second generation now allowing us to try their family recipe. Don’t think about it just come and have the best breakfast you will eat in Seoul. Gamsahamnida!
One of the best location to get a hot bowl of porridge. Abalone, chicken, prawn, mushroom….. just a warm bowl of delicious porridge.

Small area, normally busy and filled up with people very quickly. Simply one of the best in Seoul.

It's a bit hidden compared to the bigger stores closer to the main access of the ""shopping"" area right outside the traditional village. Definitely stop by!!!

The finest barbeque restaurant i've been to in Jeju. Worth a visit again, and willing to do so.
A restaurant in a tourist area with table settings for tourists.
As I was the only customer, I went in with no expectations, but the owner's friendly first words immediately put my doubts aside.
I had a delicious pork bulgogi set meal.
The Jeju fish and garlic were also really delicious.
The price is 12,000 won, which may be expensive compared to other restaurants, but I ate very well for the price.
Please thrive and maintain it.
I will definitely look for it again.
Have lunch next to Seongeup Folk Village
This meal is spicy fried black pig + volcanic eruption fried rice
Iberico pork is eaten wrapped with a variety of lettuce and Korean sauce. It’s really delicious.
The spiciness is not too spicy
Finally, add a pile of seaweed rice, top with egg juice and cheese and mix with the rice.

We found this place randomly on Naver and stopped by. The food was very fresh and the portion sizes were huge. We got the raw fish set and there were at least 3-4 course, each with lots of plates of food.

I went there when I was young and went back again after I started drinking, and it's really good as a side dish with drinks!
It's not tasty. The soup is bitter and has no refreshing taste. Disappointment, disappointment, great disappointment... I ordered two medium-sized bowls for 50,000 won, but I got stir-fried rice and a bottle of makgeolli for 111,000 won. It's not very cheap compared to the price, but it's not that good... I'll never go back to this place, and the seafood isn't very fresh.
This is a very traditional and delicious seafood stew restaurant.
Highly recommended.
The building next door is a parking building, so parking is convenient (free), and the bus stop is right in front.
It’s been a while since I had a delicious seafood stew and a lot of fried rice!! I’m willing to go next time as well^^

When you think of Busan, you think of nakkopsae.
A rare shop where you can eat nakkobse for just one person!
There was a photoshoot of Solitary Gourmet at the Obuchi store, but I went to the Bonichi store!

Nakkopsae has exquisite spiciness and richness.
It was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten.
The side dishes were also delicious.
There was no lunch break, so I was able to take it easy.
It's delicious and not too spicy! The entrance looks small, but inside it's spacious and the toilets are clean and spacious, and the host's customer service was polite and nice! Locals were coming in one after another!

There is a big difference in taste between a simple planer and a Korean pork planer.
Recommend ordering for one dollar.
It's a shame that they give you a random amount every time you go.
A place worth visiting at least once. Service and atmosphere were okay, but the pork was ok.  What about beef? It's chewy and tasty, so I wouldn't recommend it.
I like eating thinly sliced ​​pork belly without any burden.
After eating everything, add bean sprouts, kimchi, mushrooms, dried seaweed powder, and sesame oil.
Stir-fried rice is a delicacy.
There aren't many side dishes, but it's a good place for a quick meal.
A Daepae Samgyeop specialty restaurant worth visiting in Beomil-dong. Served by two young men from Uzbekistan. There was an Uzbek girl at first, and she was so pretty that a lot of people flirted with her. It doesn't come out.

It's an ordinary Korean restaurant. There is a parking lot for about 15 cars, or you can park at the farmers market right across the street. The interior of the restaurant is clean and the food is good.
Personally, my favorite menu item was bean sprout hangover soup.
It disappeared and new soft tofu appeared.
First of all, the seolleongtang wasn't very hot and the soup and meat tasted ordinary.
The taste of kimchi and kkakdugi is also ordinary! For some reason, the whole thing tasted like it was made in a factory.

As expected, I like our country’s style.
Maybe it's because I don't eat crab often.
A magic that appeals more to Skidashi than to the main menu.
Snow crab ramen there!
Strange in a place like this
Things like rice balls, fried rice, and ramen taste better.

The best crustacean is, of course, shrimp!!
The side dishes were plentiful and the crab was delicious! The ramen had snow crab in it and the fried rice was plentiful, so I was really full. 👍👍
The price was a bit expensive, but it was delicious enough. The price was reasonable for 1 king crab and 1 snow crab.
Usually there are a lot of king crab items.
There are a lot of fresh and big ones.
Crabs are really delicious
The initial price is 3,000 won.
As the price is cheap, the composition is a bit disappointing.

We came to eat on the public holiday. The Hageul festival. The spicy beef soup but not too much for our mouth is delicious. The restaurant is clean. Thanks to the cook and waitress with such a pleasant smile, that is missing in some restaurants. Thank you so much  !!
This is a restaurant where you feel like you had a good meal!
I wish it was a little spicy... It wasn't that spicy at all. Still, this is good~♡
The spicy taste is stronger than the original spicy taste of Yukgaejang, so I feel uncomfortable swallowing the soup because I am afraid of getting sick.
The meat seemed a little tough, so I guess it comes down to personal preference. This is an evaluation of soft tofu beef stew.

It tastes good when eaten with sweet and sour pork with onions.

The noodles were not noodles with black rice in them. The Ganjajang tasted like thicker Jjajang than Ganjjajang. There was plenty of meat, but it was greasy and had a different taste from the fresh soy sauce.
. The jjambbong was so watery that I wondered if broth had been used. You could say it was clean, but it was more disappointing than when I visited before.
Sweet and sour pork was delicious! 3 stars because of the sweet and sour pork...
The staff were also friendly!
The Jjamppong soup is not greasy and is very light. Too light. The portion is large for the price and there is a lot of seafood.
Huchai is delicious and friendly. I would 100% visit again.
The course meal is good. It’s awesome.
I stopped by for a quick dinner.
I ordered Yusanseul rice bowl.
The price is 10,000 won.
Since the noodles are made with black rice, they feel like a healthy meal.

My rating is primarily driven by the food quality. It is quite expensive which is somewhat expected of a place like this right on Golf Course road.
It is expensive. However, you will know why it has to be expensive after having a bite of food at this place. Good Quality Sushi you can get at this restaurant. It is the best quality campare to the others. Kindly visit this place if you want to have real Korean or Japanese taste.
Limited menu but incredibly tasty! Banchan was so delicious and big!
One of my favourite places to eat in Gurgaon! Par excellence and you couldn’t imagine the food quality and authenticity here.

I always hear it every time we have a family gathering! It doesn't taste like meat, it's delicious, the facilities are spacious, and the parking lot is wide!! I recommend it as a family restaurant.
Aussy beef galbi was pretty good for the price. Very reasonably priced and good service. The building had a weird look, but ample parking. Recommended.

I don't know if it was the noisy atmosphere of the restaurant itself or the area itself, but it was too noisy for the impression that I visited for a gathering. The seasoning of the meat was a little less sweet and there was a lot of fat on it, which was a bit of a nuisance. There were chairs placed at the entrance of the restaurant to see if it was a smoking area. There are many family gatherings with children who smoke cigarettes, but isn't this a bit much? They had to make a separate smoking booth or they smoked at the entrance, which made me feel bad even before eating.
They are friendly. If you park near the entrance, they will guide you right away.

The raw fish is delicious and the raw sushi is also delicious.
I stopped by because I was craving some cool raw fish on a hot summer day. The house I know nearby was too crowded, so I went there instead. Both taste and price are good. It is especially safe because all the seats are in rooms.
Hmm...the interior feels like a Japanese restaurant from a long time ago.
I don't think many young people will like it.
There seems to be a difference in opinion as well.

Beef as a side dish? I was impressed by the small detail of putting it in hot water so it doesn't cool down. All three types of kimchi are delicious...
Those who want warm brisket soup need to visit at least once to try it. Due to the nature of brisket soup and gomtang, the restaurant menu is a bit expensive. However, it is not more expensive than the price of similar stores. The side dishes are clean and good, and the brisket stew has a lot of meat and the taste is clean. It would be a good idea to keep in mind that the store has sit-down seating when visiting.
The store and restrooms are clean, and the owner is proud of the quality of the beef. The food is neat and delicious, which is a bonus. I get drunk every now and then
I hesitated because it was a unique menu, but when I tried it, the rich broth and soft brisket were the best. It was so good that I felt like I was just pampering myself. It's a bit pricey... but it's not a waste of money, so if you're around, I recommend stopping by.~~

I just went there and the taste is really gone. I've been going here since 1997 and the food is terrible now. The taste is gone, but they took the intestines out of the assorted sundae without saying a word. There are intestines on the menu, but they need to change the menu first. And I'm really bad at frying rice. I'm just annoyed after coming here.
Revisited after 13 years. Still a delicious house. When I visited before, I remember waiting a long time because it was during the day on a weekend, but when I went on a Sunday evening, I got in right away without waiting. There were many guests. I think I will come again next time.
The food is not spicy, but it has a taste that keeps you going.
Even children who have just started to taste spicy food continue to eat it with water.

Because it is an old house, the lighting is very dark, so it is tiring for the eyes, and it feels a bit lacking for the price, and the floors are not cleaned well, so it's not great...
It's good value for money. It's delicious, the side dishes are clean, and they're friendly. Plus, they even provide valet parking. The only regret is that today's food all tasted a little salty.  It would be a good idea to check it out. Everything else was good.
I went there with my parents on Mother's Day, and I eat there often since I'm a regular, but I only ate the steamed monkfish and when I went there, I saw that there were a lot of varieties and it was delicious. I highly recommend the monkfish stew as well as the seafood stew.

Now I know there was a buffet like this in Sasang!
Well, since the owner changed in September 2017, there have been more changes than before. I think there are quite a few people who don't know about it yet.
The regular buffet is operated by reservation only. The weekday lunch special changes daily with a daily menu, so it was great to be able to eat about 15 to 18 different dishes for the low price of 6,500 won.
Why does a bowl of soup cost 7,000 to 8,000 won these days? For 3 to 4 side dishes...
However, since I can taste various types of food at a low price... the cost-effectiveness is great... I am very satisfied with the quality of the food... I don't miss home-cooked meals!
Not bad for a lunch special buffet for 6,500 won. There were a lot of menu items for the price and the basic taste was good. Personally, I was disappointed that there were no plums.

Strongly recommend! Best dishes good price! Kind staff!
The food is delicious and the employees are very kind.
Amazing service and food!
To a freshwater eel specialty store in Hanam.
It's a difficult location to visit if you don't have a car.

Please search and see if you can visit.
Required. There is ample parking for the store.
I feel like I'm doing it. (Appears to be approximately 10 years old)

Meal stew and perilla seed sujebi were also good.

A perfect place for a hungry traveler from the airport. It was full of locals and tourists which you can find out by a long queue in front of the restaurant. Although Kookbap was only 8500KRW, they serve a hearty amount of this decent soup.

I had fun and enjoyed it while eating it.
It is a large restaurant with a quiet mountain temple feel at the foot of Gudeoksan Mountain.  There are lots of group seating and many bungalows for families. I especially like the large parking lot.
The service was perfect, from the family comfort to the quick response of the staff.

I went there because I heard the meat was delicious, but I think I would have gotten a different score if I had had another single meal. Not recommended for the meat! There was a lot of scaffolding and the fire had to be done in one stage, so it took a long time~
Jeju raw meat is delicious.
The radish vegetables that came with it are also good.
I went because the meat was cheap.
There were so many people that conversation was difficult.
Drink your own water cup and side dishes are on the table.
It was inconvenient to order because there was no button.
I should go when I have some free time.
Anyway, the meat is delicious^^
There are a variety of menus, but I ate Jeju raw meat pork belly. It's old-style pork belly, and the downside is that it's an old facility, so the ventilation is poor, so when you finish eating, the smell of pork belly will hit your body and clothes.
It’s delicious~^^
It would be hard to find a place these days where raw Jeju pork belly costs 5,000 won. As such, it is good value for money. Because it is a restaurant near the industrial complex, many workers visit. It was famous among workers, but it became even more famous after a YouTuber came to visit, so it seems to be getting more and more people.  A great place to have a casual meal or drink.
I haven't tried the main menu yet.
However, I tried bulgogi, soybean paste stew, and kimchi stew.
The bulgogi wasn't the beef bulgogi I was expecting, but it was spicy, had a lot of meat, and was delicious, and the soybean paste stew was also incredibly delicious, as the restaurant is famous for it.
If you order stew, there are quite a lot of side dishes such as fried eggs, sausage, and fish, just like a regular meal. Even though the stew costs 7,000 won.
If you order raw meat, which is the main menu item, it will be sliced ​​right at the table. I haven't tried it yet, but seeing as it's a store that many famous YouTubers have visited, I think it's proven to some extent.
The grandmother may be working alone, but there are not many tables inside, but there are many people seated there.
I plan to come next time to try the meat and leave a review again.

The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The food was also  served very quickly so I would recommend even if you don't have much time for lunch.
I visited 대궐안집. The restaurant's meat was fresh, so it tasted great. But, they were expensive. Waiters are friendly to customers. And the vibe was good. In the restaurant, there is a cafe. When you go there, i recommend beef. Another menu is also good.
Previous wad much better than now. quality service is soso....and price is not good.
1. Galbi-tang is the main menu. 2. Despite the large restaurant, it is very clean. 3. You may have to wait a little because a lot of people come. 4. Galbi-tang costs 15,000 won. 5. Unfortunately, it is not delivered.
I was really good but my sister said it is not reasonble price with common taste.

Amazing Experience!!! A dream came True!!! Totally worth it!!! Don't waste your time so book the bus and cable ticket!!!! Almost 4 hours lasts the overall experience! Go very early in The morning! We arrived 08:30 and it was perfect!
It is my first visiting the Great Wall. Since we came on the weekday, the visitors weren't so many. The weather is quite friendly as well. Feel free and enjoy taking pictures in every single moment or place. Not queue 😃
This is truly one of the best reasons to visit China. This is not to be missed. We took the ski lift up ( and down) instead of the steps. You will hike up plenty of steps on the wall so safe your energy for that. There are steep steps and many are not even. Take your time. You can hike up and down the wall for as much time as you wish. The views are truly stunning. You can take a toboggan down in some places if you wish. They looked rather worn. It is hard to imagine how this wall seems to go on forever and how high it actually is. Truly a wonder.
Wow!! It's just stunning when you are standing at the Great Wall of China❤️ MUST VISIT while you're in Beijing. Highly recommend to purchase tickets in advance, skip the line and also just using your passport scan to enter, very convenient.

It's a restaurant with many advantages:

1) Directly slaughtering beef and serving only the best parts

2) Clean and delicious side dishes

3) Even rice soup worth paying to eat separately.

There are few meat restaurants in Seoul that have impressed me this much.

The best beef restaurant in Busan! The restaurant has been renovated, so it's clean and the service is good! Strong recommendation!
The staff is friendly and the basic side dish settings are good.
The meat was delicious because it was touple, and the soybean paste stew was worth eating. However, it is not cheap compared to the grade. Considering the touple, it is not enough to fill your stomach with only meat, but it is close to 180,000 won. Haha. The short ribs were a bit disappointing because they had a lot of fatty parts like salchisal or upjinsal, and the sirloin was not good. It was good, but it was a shame it was too thin. Still, the meat tasted quite good. A lot of people come for lunch, so I think I should try the Yukhoe Bibimbap or Yukhoe Bibim Ramen next time.
I visited because I wanted to eat Yukhoe Bibimbap.
As a driver, it was very convenient to have a parking space. If you order Yukhoe Bibimbap, the blood sausage soup that comes with it is also excellent.
I am 100% willing to visit again.
The food, service, and atmosphere are the best ^^ Not only the taste of the meat, but also the surrounding side dishes, raw beef bibimbap, and galbitang, there is nothing that is not delicious. It's so great.
It's the best.
The combination of blood sausage soup and beef bibimbap is a really good combination for lunch for office workers. However, I feel that the price is a little expensive. After the remodeling, parking has become more convenient and the interior is also neat and tidy. It is one of Busan’s representative restaurants. I hope it does well for a long time and becomes a 100-year-old store. ^^

You can use the salad bar, so you can bring as many vegetables as you like, get your own Vietnamese spring roll refills, and there are drinks as well. The amount of meat is reasonable for the price, but the soba noodles, which I like, are not very tasty. Every time I go, I always get caught...

It's been a while since I was impressed by natural taste!
The basic side dishes are okay, and the hamo shell jelly is not refillable.
(The taste was unique)
Hamohoe I couldn't taste anything. It felt like sekoshi (bone and meat together)!
The Hamo Shabu Shabu comes whole with the bones missing, and when you dip it in the broth, it blooms like a flower..🤩
It came with a special sauce, but when I dipped it in, it wasn't salty and it was delicious!!!
At the staff's recommendation, I ate porridge first and then ramen noodles.
When I made ramen, the soup went in, so when I ate the porridge later, it was a bit bland, so I set aside the soup and ate the porridge, but the staff made the first part for me first. They were kind and brought out the side dishes quickly when I requested them.
However, because the surrounding area is a bit noisy, it is difficult to call the staff 😂
It felt like I was eating a Hamo course meal, but it was properly nourishing.

The total amount
Hamohoe (small) 70,000 + Hamo shabu-shabu (medium) 110,000 + porridge 4,000 (minimum 2 people) + ramen sari 2,000 = 186,000
2020-06-25 Douglas Fir Hamo Sashimi Shabu Shabu

It might be personal preference, but
I wonder if this is a fish that Hamo would pay this price for.
Only the sauce is slightly different from the poached conger eel (hamo yubiki) eaten in Yeosu, but the broth and eating method are the same.
The prices are scary even in Yeosu, but four adults could eat one meal worth 140,000 won and finished off with Hamotang. I think this is a pretty reasonable(?) price.
The 8,000 won hamotang is a Gyeongbuk-style loach stew, cooked in a mild vegetable soup style and very delicious.
It's hard to recommend it because of the price, but you can taste delicious pike eel in Busan without having to go to Yeosu, and it's not inferior to the taste of Yeosu.
A place where you can enjoy delicious raw conger eel or shabu-shabu. The pike eel stew is also delicious. You can park right in front of the store or on the breakwater behind the store. Closed on the first and third Sundays.
However, the somewhat expensive price and unfriendly attitude of the staff are disappointing.
A place where you can eat Hamo Shabu Shabu.
It is worth eating as a delicacy in summer.
The price is a bit expensive, but I recommend it.
As of August 2017, one piece worth 100,000 won is enough to feed 2-3 people.

The pork soup at Sinchang Gukbap is very honest in its flavor.
The pork is very tender with no off-flavors, and the flavor of the miso or shrimp dipping sauce will keep you coming back for more. The pork sundae is also very soft and doesn't have the characteristic sundae odor, so it tastes great when dipped in Sinchang's sauce. The pork sundae is also very soft and has no distinctive sundae flavor. The pork soup has a very refreshing flavor and doesn't have the porky smell typical of pork soup. It has a very clean flavor that reminds you of the last time you ate soup.  I highly recommend Sinchang Gukbap. It's the best pork soup I've ever had. I didn't take a picture of the pork soup because it was so delicious.
It's good, allright, there are organs and blood sausage in the normal soup.  If those are not your cup of tea, be forewarned.   Broth is tasty and the blood sausage is on point.

It is slightly expensive since the 7000 won indicated on the menu gets you half portion of soba. However, it has the best texture of all the soba I had so it was worth it. The dipping sauce is good too. Udon is slightly below average. Udon noodle was a bit soggy.
Mediocre compared with the past. This is why it is not crowded any more, still less a line. A shame.

The Palgakjeong Pavilion on Bugak Skyway is a place of remarkable serenity and beauty throughout the year. Positioned at an elevation of 345 meters on Bugaksan's extensive 1,652,900 square meter summit, this traditional Korean-style pavilion has captivated many visitors and has become a beloved city attraction.

The nighttime views from this pavilion, perched on top of the mountain, are undeniably breathtaking, creating unforgettable moments with cherished loved ones. However, we noticed that the pavilion itself is showing signs of wear and outdatedness. We believe that renovation of the pavilion and overall cleaning of the area could greatly enhance the experience of enjoying this beautiful place.
Incredible views and a great place to stop for lunch, I would definitely recommend getting a lift up then walking back down, there were many cyclists riding up though
The place has a great view and a good fancy café. The café is quite expensive although if you purchase a drink in the café, you will receive a free parking receipt. You should walk there because the scenery is breathtaking. I suggest going in at spring-time when the cherry blossoms are in bloom or in the fall when the leaves are turning crimson. Summer time was too damn hot 🥵.

The first taste of steamed stingray is a slightly sweet and spicy sauce with a very light stingray soft texture. It goes well with another flavor when mixed with rice and ramen.
It's a delicious restaurant

In Daegu, on average, stingray stingray is spicy, but in Busan, it was soy sauce-based, so I couldn't find the place I wanted.

I was recommended a red and spicy-based stingray stew restaurant by an acquaintance, so I went right away.

Delicious… .damn… ..better than what I ate in Daegu hahahahaha

I feel like there may be differences of opinion, but it's definitely a good restaurant. Subjectively, it feels like tteokbokki, which a lot of women eat. I'm kind of addicted to it.

Because it is a long distance, you have to drive for about 20-30 minutes, but it is worth the distance and time to get there.

The combination of squid sundae on the side is just perfect.

There is also a drawback: it is expensive.
But you have to eat it lol

100% intention to revisit
Sweet steamed fish is worth eating once when you go round Haeundae Beach. The price is not cheap and the portion size is large enough for two people. The change from sitting to a table is very welcome.
It was delicious the first time I ate it. The second time I went, the fish felt old. Only my parents go sometimes, and one person got sick. They went again the next time, but my mother didn't go because she felt strange looking at the fish flesh. My father and a friend of mine got scolded for running out that day. I called the store and said I was from the neighborhood and needed to be careful. I said I didn't mean to ask for money. They say there are no apples and the ingredients are fresh. Isn't it basic to apologize first? And even if it comes frozen, do you thaw it in water? Is it thawed naturally in the refrigerator? It's thawed, but they keep soaking it in water because they're busy, leaving it to become mushy. Even if the ingredients are the same, the condition of the ingredients can be very different depending on how the person prepares it.

First of all, fresh eels and sea eels are in the aquarium, so they are caught and cleaned right away, so there is no need to doubt their freshness. The price is cheaper than other commercial restaurants, but there are not many types of side dishes and you can focus on the eel, which is also an advantage. The seasoning is delicious and they give you everything from the head to the internal bones, so it's fun to grill each part. Since it is an eel restaurant, it is a shame that you have to eat it only with chojang without cabbage or soybean powder. Still, I was quite satisfied because I was able to taste Busan's soft, fluffy, and chewy anago raw fish. The original taste of the food is good, but there are only 3 people working compared to the customers, including 1 foreign part-timer, so it is difficult to receive proper service due to the shortage of workers. I brought a lot of my own drinks, but even in the crowded environment, they handled everything well with customers. The eel stew is a Gyeongsang-do style clear type and flavored with sansho pepper, so those from other regions should think twice before ordering. I recommend it to those who like Busan. It is rich and savory and tastes good. It's in front of the beach, so the view is nice and the taste is good. I recommend the grilled eel.
The eel was tasty, but the portion was small.
It is said that Anagu raw fish has a slightly different feel and does not have its own taste as the bones have been completely removed.
Eel soup was evaluated as the most delicious.
Straw fire eel or grilled eel are fresh!
Grilled over charcoal, we liked the straw eel, but the eel stew wasn't very tasty as it wasn't very tasty!
It's good for drinking, but it's a shame that eel stew isn't enough for a meal!
The staff is nice and friendly, but the menu is disappointing. I wish there was ginger salad and spicy soup. Hahaha, my daughter and I made 1kg of straw fire, 1kg of eel, 3 bottles of eel stew, and 3 bottles of soju.
104,000 Won Cost-effective?
I add one star because the eel was fresh!
I got hungry after watching the Gijang Anchovy Festival and heard about this restaurant.
Wow, it was really delicious. It was chewy and light.
It's my first time eating it, but it's really delicious.
It is easy to find as it is located inside the entrance to Daebyeon Port and has parking for about 5 to 6 cars.
The owner seems to be working alone... It took a long time to set up after ordering.
There are a variety of menu items such as eel, black eel, and eel stew.
Delicious without any fishy taste. The seasoning is especially sweet and delicious.

The combination of light bean sprout stew and braised tofu is great.
This is a hidden(?) restaurant located in the old city center near Daejeon Citizen University. Although it is less famous for its taste and cost-effectiveness, it is comparable to most bean sprout soup/stew restaurants. The signature dish of this restaurant is definitely bean sprout stew, but other menu items are also above average and the prices are reasonable, making it perfect for everything from simple meals to company dinners. The side dishes provided are neat and tidy, so you can have a bowl of rice before the main menu is served. Parking is available in front of the restaurant, but it is a bit crowded, so you can use the nearby public parking lot, but be careful as it is chargeable on weekdays. Or, it could be done a little further away on the site of the former South Chungcheong Provincial Office. After a meal, there are many good cafes nearby, so it's a great place to enjoy a cup of coffee. This is a place worth stopping by if you come to the old downtown of Jung-gu, Daejeon.
A place where you can have a hangover even if you don’t drink alcohol

Thanks to our local friend for introducing us to this hidden gem! This place deserves all the hype - the food is incredible. Their chicken stew was so good, I had second helpings, and it completely changed my mind about soy-marinated crabs (drool-worthy even now!). The atmosphere is fantastic, though later closing hours would be the icing on the cake.
Love the makgeolli, all the food was so yummy, especially the chicken pot and pancake! Highly recommended :)
So delicious!! The waiters were super friendly and the food was so yummy! We loved the chicken, pancake, and grilled fish. The fish was perfectly crispy and tender inside, and was liked even by people who didn’t like seafood! Great vibes inside as well, clean and felt like home!

The straw fire eel is delicious and the seasoning is delicious, but I think the size and quantity of the eel is rather small. They provided ramen for the event and took good care of parking. The side dishes are also good.
It's been a while since I went on a trip to Busan. My husband lived in Busan for a long time, but I don't remember eating it since I was young, but still.
I visited because I was told that I had to try the eel when I came to Gijang.

Two 6th graders and three adults visited.
Since it was my first time eating eel, I thought about it and ordered a special set.
They said that menu wasn't suitable for 5 people.
This is our first time seeing this and we have children.
While I was saying that I would try it and order more, I was very surprised when I stopped talking and raised my voice and said that the children would not be able to eat maeuntang because it had banga leaves in the sancho.
My kids tend to eat a variety of foods, and I didn't plan on eating less. I was going to give them a taste and add something that suited them, but the taste was gone before I could eat it. I didn't want to ruin the trip, so I held on to it. The taste was good, and the other staff were all nice.
Because of him, I don't want to go back again.

I didn't order a small amount, so why did you do that?
Busan sea eel is delicious.
Personally, I think the seasoning is better than straw fire.
The price seems a little expensive.
The whole area seems to be that price.
Luckily, I made a reservation on Naver and got room 5. There are 3 tables and there are 2 tables for 10 people including children. The people working are really friendly and the food is so good that there is no shortage of food. Every single side dish is good. I plan to come back. 5-person set, add salt for 2 people

You can eat out, and there is also a direct sales store for Korean beef, so you can buy it in packs and take it home.
Even if you traveled by car, parking was easy as there was ample parking in front of the store!

The exterior of the store is a Hanok building, and the front yard and surrounding areas are uniquely decorated, making it easy to look around.
You can go up to the second floor via the stairs or elevator.
Usually, you can just visit, but if there are a lot of people or there are many reservations, the waiting time may be long.
So, we recommend making a reservation in advance!
Since we were dining with a large family, we made a reservation about 2 weeks in advance and were shown to our room.

This is Song Ha-won’s menu.
The representative menu is of course Korean beef, and in addition to Korean beef platter, sirloin, and leaf meat, there are special cuts such as inner ribs, flower meat, and inner spider.
And the raw meat here is truly a delicacy, so I highly recommend trying it!
We ordered 5 servings of assorted grilled Korean beef, and then added the meat in the following order: pork belly, ribeye, and sirloin.
(I couldn't eat the spiders on this day because they said they were all sold out...)

The basic table setting is served immediately after ordering, and there are many types of side dishes.

section
White Kimchi
Myeongnamul
Pickles
Pickled pieces
Pickled onions
salad
Nurungji
Ssam vegetables
Kimchi

It's not just to fill up the numerous side dishes, but every single one of them is so delicious that you'll want to keep ordering it.
They give us ginseng and raw beef as a service, but I guess I'm getting older because the scent of ginseng now feels better for me than the bitter taste...

As soon as I tasted the raw fish, I ordered 350g separately.
The fresh color and fragrant aroma coming from the finely chopped perilla leaves looks very appetizing.
The combination of the crunchy texture of raw meat and the subtle scent of perilla leaves is just a thumbs up!
Even if you order it separately, you won't regret it at all.

And finally, the grilled Korean beef platter came out!
The assortment consists of sirloin, tenderloin, leaf meat, and brisket.
Since all the meat is delicious, put as much as possible on the grill and grill it all at once.
I ate one piece at a time, starting with the golden brown sirloin.
Wow, it’s just a beautiful taste. It's a taste that makes my shoulders shake~
Korean beef that melts in your mouth probably refers to this.

It was full of juice and I could really feel the soft quality of Korean beef.
You can eat it with sesame oil or with pickled green onions, pickled onions, or ssam vegetables according to your personal preference.
But no matter how you eat it, it’s just delicious!!!

By the time I finished eating the meat, I ordered a meal and cold noodles.
The meal consists of rice and soybean paste stew. If you order rice in a stone pot, it will take about 20 minutes, so you must order it in advance.
The staff serves the stone pot rice in bowls in front of you, and even makes and brings it to you.
Soybean paste stew is a common taste, but it has finely chopped Korean beef, which adds to the richness.
Mulnaengmyeon was so so-so because it tasted basic among basics.
Lastly, if you slurp down the sungnyung, you will end up with a clean dining experience.

You can pay at the counter near the entrance, but you can get a 10% discount if you use the gallery cafe on the third floor, which is just above.
Since it was a suburban area, it was better than finding a separate cafe and going there, so I headed straight to the cafe.
I will continue my post about Songha Gallery Cafe in the next post!
Please note that even if you do not go to the cafe, you can use the sujeonggwa and coffee vending machines.

Songhawon is a grilled cow restaurant where you can eat various parts of premium cow in one place.
The meat quality and taste of all parts of Korean beef are good, and the tables and rooms are well divided, making it a great place to eat out.
Personally, I have a 200% intention to visit again, and I plan to visit again soon.
I went there for the first time today, and the quality of the meat was very good.
The side dishes were also neat, so I was able to fully enjoy the taste of Korean beef.
I recommend it.
Next to it, there is a ceramics gallery and a tea drinking place.
It was fun to look around.
새로운 맛의 경험,  가격은 좀 있지만,  가족과 함께라면 한번,  두번 정도 올수 있다는 생각,  일단,  주변 조경 완전 좋음,  일반 식당과는 비교할수 없는 고기맛 최고
Just thinking about the price, does it feel expensive?
Considering the price of Korean beef, this is a great value restaurant.
The raw meat is fresh, the seasoning is delicious, and the portion is generous.
Each type of beef melts smoothly👍
They say the angiosperm is delicious, but it falls off and I can't eat it.
It looks like they are using meat in the building next door.
A great place to eat good meat with good people

The conger eel sashimi is fluffy and spicy. Assorted raw fish has no fishy smell and is clean. The shad was delicious. The staff was friendly and it was easy to make a reservation over the phone.

Due to get there in Chuseok national holiday, some people visited there to make a pray for their family who were passed away.
We loved it! Beautiful temple and other buildings. It seems like nobody knows this hidden gem in Haeundae, only a handful visitors were there, but it was definitely one of my favorite places in my visit to Busan.
Beautifull view of the city and very nice temple. You can fully enjoy the atmosphere of the spiritual side of Korean buddhism. Listening to the monks chants while being surrounded by modern and continuously developing city. Its trully magical. I come back everytime I visit Busan.

I must say there was a LOT of food! We managed to eat most of it. There were abalone, sea cucumber, prawns, various fishes, hot fish soup, cold fish soup, seaweed soup. We did not have dinner that night!

The lady who helped us do not speak English so we used Google translate, she was very helpful and patient; bless her. We gave her a tip for her kindless and consideration.

Please do visit if you are in Jung-dong, Busan.
Highlight of the trip. The employees were super friendly, the view is amazing and the food was absolutely great. Will definitely revisit!
Had an amazing experience for dinner!  Had the 80k won/person meal. The whole dinner was very unique and tasted great! The sashimi was very fresh. Make a reservation if you can, as this place can get very busy. Would definitely recommend coming here.
Slightly disappointing that I cannot select just the food that I want, but its fine, I went with a Korean course meal, which the food was average ( it was alright  but if I were to compare against other seafood places there are better food choices), the scenery of the sea is good, guess that's the climax. I had service from lunch which was great. But I had a disappointing and rather insulting service after lunch from afternoon staff...(please believe one can have afternoon drinks after lunch ) seriously, the rudeness ...
You may taste fresh and delicious sea foods in this place.
But it will be somewhat high price but you will be pleased.
The restaurant serves spicy food and non-spicy seafood.

The location is a big plus, being conveniently near the beach, which is perfect for a nice evening stroll after dinner.However, the service left something to be desired.

The staff were a bit pushy with orders and not very welcoming. While the service was fast and efficient, the prices were on the higher side, reflecting the premium quality of the beef. Additionally, the wine selection is expensive and not well-described, so it might be better to avoid it or bring your own bottle.

Overall, it's a good spot for a quality dinner, but there's definitely room for improvement in service and transparency with the wine list.
The staff are all friendly and most of all, the meat is amazing.

We narrowly missed lunch, arriving at 12:07pm just as the line was finishing. Determined to try once and for all, we returned at 3pmPM and were fortunate to be the first in line. By 5pm, the line had wrapped around the building.

Regrettably, despite being the first seated for dinner, the raw ribs were still sold out.
I recommend going all out and ordering as many marinated ribs as your heart desires—they taste amazing when cooked on that charcoal grill. The soybean paste stew had pieces of ribs in it and was bursting with flavor. We also ordered bulgogi and potato noodles, which soaked up the bulgogi marinade nicely. The salad and other banchan really elevated the meal. Overall, this was our favorite meal in Busan.
This was the best Korean bbq restaurant we have had during this holiday. The side dishes were more tasteful than other restaurants and the meat was unbelievable tender and tasteful, also because of specific scoring technique they apply to the beef. The service was outstanding and we will always remember this restaurant in Busan. This is really worth waiting for!
This is a popular restaurant in Busan. You have to arrive before opening to queue and join the waitlist to get a spot. It’s pricy in comparison to other galbi restaurants, but the meat is fresh and flavourful. Our highlight was the patata noodles on the grill mixed with the bulgogi sauce at the end of the meal… that’s was really tasty. We do recommend coming for the experience but it’s true that it’s a bit overly hipped.
Long wait (about 1.5 hours in the queue and we got there at 5 on the dot) but worth it for the best KBBQ short ribs we’ve ever had. Really fair pricing too. My rec: get there at 5 on the dot, add yourself to the queue, and then go nearby for a drink until you’re about 5 in line.
We had a really good memory of this restaurant ten years ago so came back for a high expectation.  After waiting for an hour and a half, we were so disappointed; the Galbi meat was too tough with too much fat, stew was too bland, rice smelled a little.  Considering how much it cost. We will not return ever.

A very homely type diner. Food is prepared fresh. That broth is heavenly
We loved whole chicken soup with mung beans.
It was big and filled up our stomachs well. ❤️
The side dishes’ tastes were awesome, especially the kimchi was amazing. 😍
The owners and staff were having decent customer service. We enjoyed our meal and time here.
My first visit to Busan. Second time eating Ginseng Chicken and drinking the soup. The restaurant advertised that the soup is without any MSG. True to it’s advertisement, it was without the MSG. However, due to the lack of such seasoning the taste can be rather bland. You need to add some salt and ginseng wine into the soup to spice it up. Overall, it was tasty nonetheless.
Samgyetang means Korean ginseng chicken soup. This Samgyetang restaurant offers simple menu that really help foreigners easily order the authentic Korean cuisine. The chicken soup is very delicious and the side dishes are tasty as well.

Delicious food. Abalone Bibimbap was great. Oyster pancake was very nice. Very huge portions at reasonable rates. Staff will refill and are very friendly.
Galbi, marinated and non marinated, was tasty and has a good portion per serving. Also, they offered  plenty of side dishes(banchans). But I think the price is pretty expensive and it's not going to be easy dining experience with price point.
Fresh and yummy sea food. We had set b for 23k per pax. Would recommend
The value for money here is incredible. Granted, Tongyeong oysters do not yet compare to those available in other classic oyster powerhouses such as New Zealand or France but they are as briny and tasty as any other decent oyster available anywhere else in the world.

We had the fresh oysters and the batter fried oysters here and we were so stuffed with such tasty fare that we had to set aside a good amount of the fried oysters to takeaway.

The meal also came with a free fresh oyster gochujang salad as part of the banchan!

Highly recommended!!

It's great to eat grilled meat with the family. They are friendly and have a baby chair. This is a restaurant where you feel like you are treated well and have your own side dishes prepared neatly. It's a great place to take the elderly and is suitable for family gatherings. The meat is delicious and the raw beef mix is ​​also very delicious. I think I will visit again.
It's delicious..
Just looking at the taste, I think the Gupo branch tastes better, perhaps because of my mood.
However, I was overwhelmed by the overwhelming interior and atmosphere.
The staff were neatly dressed and it just made my day feel good. It was the best!
Visited on a Sunday evening.
Easy parking, clean interior, and wide spacing between tables for comfort.
The quality of the meat was better than the 1st restaurant.
Best of all, it's nice that the basic side dishes are served for one person.

Although I didn't have the opportunity to visit inside, the exterior alone was impressive and showcased the building's grandeur and elegance.

Another beautiful place on the map of Muscat, which is worth visiting. There are different architecture styles used to create this building. The building is surrounded by the park with lots of flowers and other plants.  The posh shopping gallery is nearby.
Amazing place with impressive architecture. We didn’t book a show, but you can still enter (ticket 3 OMR) and get a 15 minute guided „tour“ where they show you around and explain everything. It’s quite interesting and really remarkable in terms of architecture and design. Recommend.

I visited the Jongno restaurant Obaltan Jongno branch and tried a variety of menu items, including daechang, special noodles, tenderloin, lamb rice, and lamb beef stew.

​The price is over 200,000 won, but it is well worth the price. I felt the portion was a little lacking, but after eating the lamb rice, that thought disappeared.

The soup is clear and tasty. It is my first time trying so i couldn’t compare to other shops. I  think it was nice though the Gukbab maybe not my style of food. Recommend to try!
OMG! I didn't know that such a good restaurant is near my house.
It was so good. Form side dishes to main dishes.
This is a taste what I have never tried.
It's little bit pricey but reasonable.
A self-bar for side dishes is there, so you can enjoy it as much as you want.
The most impressive thing was brassware plates and dishes.
So this is my go-to gukbap place as Korean.
I’ve been so many gukbap places and the soup is usually very cloudy since they make stock with bone marrow for 4-8 hours.
But somehow, this place’s stock is clear as Consommé soup and clean. However you can still taste nice pork bone taste.
So if you never tried pork bone soup or if you’re big fan of pork bone soup , I highly recommend!
(진짜 깔끔한데 존맛탱.)
It became popular after a Korean celebrate had come to eat this. I like it because it looks clean. But I dont like its taste too much because it is not the genuine Busan style.
For me it was the greatest gukbap I have ever eaten. It should definitely be on your Busan checklist

Sweet and Sour Pork is yummy one :)
As I was passing by the store located in the restaurant area of ​​Lotte Department Store's Centum City branch, I saw a photo of the President's visit and quickly went in. The price is reasonable and the taste is the usual taste we know.
Aside from the slightly odd service, the view was good (of course, most of it was on the walls of the building), the furniture looked like antique China, and the oyster jjamppong was good. Oyster Jjamppong shatters the stereotype that Jjamppong must be washed! It was packed with plenty of vegetables, so I ate it without feeling burdened after my dental treatment.
It's really not good. It's not worth the cost. Jjajangmyeon is small in size and you can't eat it 3 times. The Jjamppong soup was delicious, but there wasn't much seafood, so it's worth paying that money for... The sweet and sour pork tastes a lot like flour... I really feel like it's a waste of money. I don't recommend it.

This roast duck restaurant has excellent healthy taste (^^)

Soybean paste has a decent taste, and the back meat is lighter than samgyeop, so try it when you feel like samgyeop.

I have nothing positive to say about this restaurant. Food was too pricy for what it was. It truly feels like a rip off. I perhaps had too high of expectation from all the hypes and raves from existing reviews. Sashimi came out as soon as we ordered and the food looked like something that was a day old as all the garnish was dried out. What came out after wasn't any better or fresh. Food looked sad. I thought even paying the half of what I paid would have been too much.

Soup and rice 9,000

There were many people in the neighborhood who recommended it, and they also had children's soup, so I came here with my daughter.

As standard, it comes with a rice cake and somen noodles.
The seasoning of the kimchi is not too strong, so adding about a spoonful of salted shrimp is just the right amount (personal preference) You can eat kimchi with a little bit of radish radish kimchi and kimchi kimchi. Everyone knows the taste of kimchi kimchi, and the degree of doneness of kkakdugi at a soup restaurant is important, but it was cooked just right. The meat in the soup is also common at a kukbap restaurant. There is just the right amount of soup (there is no samgyeop), and not enough. When you take the first spoonful of soup, you think, ""Hmm, why is it a good restaurant?"" 'Is it normal?' Should I say that the more I eat it, the more subtle the flavor becomes? It's attractive enough. However, it is not a house that people come from far away, but it is attractive enough in the neighborhood.

Oh, it's good to come with kids because there's children's soup.

The downside is that the garlic stalks were not removed, and I wished the temperature of the soup was hotter. The price of the separate soup is the same at 9,000, but the separate soup is served by pouring the broth from a large pot into the pot and boiling it once more, as the pot stand is placed under the pot. The regular soup is served with the broth that has already been boiled in the pot. It's the same.

Most people eat soup separately, but next time I think I will try eating soup separately.
Even though it was a weekend, parking was smooth and there were no inconveniences in using the restaurant.
When the soup comes out, there is a slight nurinne taste, but when you eat it, it is the real soup. Baeksuk meat is thick and rough, and soup meat is suitable and has a good texture. The sundae was also delicious! It's a place to stop by if you have something to do nearby.
Personally, I would like to recommend the pork soup restaurant in Busan. I've never met anyone who says this stuff doesn't taste good. Customers gradually become addicted to the taste and line up to eat.
The power of Busan people! Pork soup and rice
Since it is open 24 hours a day, you can visit at any time.  There are a variety of menus, so it's okay to go alone with your family.
It is paved, but there is the inconvenience of having to park on the side of the road.
There is a designated parking lot, but I am used to parking on the side of the road.
It's good because you can make as much kimchi as you want.
Savory gyeolmyeongja tea gives a fragrant scent.

We had a year-end dinner. This is a seafood restaurant. It is located on the 2nd floor of Mangpo-dong Food Alley. There were 4 people and we were shown to the room. The room had a cozy feel and I was satisfied with the comfortable atmosphere.

If you want to eat nakkobse during your trip to Seoul, please come here 🐙

When I went on a trip to Busan before the coronavirus outbreak, I ate nakkobse at Seomyeon and was so impressed by it that I couldn't forget it. During my trip to Busan at the time, I ate a lot of different foods, as traveling means food training, but I ended up eating nakkobse twice, pushing aside other delicious foods...it was a sinful taste.
I was finally able to go on a trip to Korea and was able to eat Nakkopsae🐙, so I'm very happy! I was on a trip to Seoul, and I really wanted to eat it, so I looked for it near Myeong-dong, and I was so happy that I was able to eat it at a restaurant✨

The lady at the store was kind and asked if she was from Japan. He taught me many things, such as how to eat. In the end, I ate 3 servings + rice and left the restaurant with a full stomach. Nakkopse is the best!

(It will be encouraging if you press [Like 👍🏻] ☺️)
It's a famous restaurant that I've been wanting to try again ever since I ate natchbokkeun (sweet and spicy stir-fried octopus) at the main branch in Busan around 2015. This time, my wish came true as the number of coronavirus cases was decreasing and I was able to come to Korea without a VISA.
Natchi Pokkun is really delicious.
The staff is friendly and cooks for you. Once you are ready to eat, you can eat on your own from then on. It is a fried fish restaurant and is famous for its fish gobsae. Fish and tripe shrimp are included as toppings, and there is also pork belly. As the number of toppings increases, the amount becomes smaller for an adult male, but the taste is good. Amazingly, it is also possible to order for just one person. I mixed it with bean sprouts and seaweed and ate it, and the meat quality was good.

It is one of the most famous places in Busan to try this traditional dish, and the Haeundae head store is popular with both locals and tourists.

Here are some things to know before going:

The restaurant is famous for its bokguk, a soup made from pufferfish, known for being a delicacy in Korea. The dish is considered safe to eat as it is prepared by skilled chefs, but pufferfish can be dangerous if not handled properly, which is why dining at a reputable place like Geumsubokguk is recommended.

Besides bokguk, the restaurant offers a variety of other dishes made from pufferfish, including fried pufferfish, pufferfish sashimi, fried pufferfish and spicy stews.

The restaurant is often busy, especially during lunch and dinner hours, so you may want to arrive early or be prepared for a wait.

Prices may be higher than at standard restaurants due to the specialty of the ingredients, but the quality and experience are usually considered worth it.

The atmosphere is traditional and welcoming, providing a good opportunity to experience authentic Korean dining in Busan.

It’s located near Haeundae Beach, so it’s a convenient stop if you’re visiting the area. The restaurant is well-known, so it should be easy to find with local directions or maps.

While some staff may speak limited English, the menu usually includes photos, and it may have some English translations, making it easier for non-Korean speakers to order.

If you're planning to try pufferfish for the first time, Geumsubokguk is a highly recommended and safe option!
First time having puffer fish.  The restaurant sources farm raised fugu, so no worries about the toxin.  The fish had a very firm texture and very mild flavor.  The soup was good, but the fried fugu nuggets were the best.
Decided to go here becauss of the specialty. Shop was very crowded with a lot of line, good sign. We enjoyed the fried one better than the soup. This is that place where you just go and try once
Golden puffer was fabulous! What a lovely surprise on my 1st visit. Staff was so kind and attentive!  :))))) Thank you for a delicious meal and delightful experience! 😋
The first time eating puffer fish, the puffer soup taste so great, sashimi and tempura are worth as well.
If you were looking for special food in Busan, here we go mate.

Everything was really good! There were five of us and we got the 70pp course. Three waitresses were courteous and only interacted with us the minimal amount, to give us the English menu of what we're getting during the course, and to tell us what the dishes were as they were coming out. The head chef came in to check in and to say hello too. All of the food was thoroughly enjoyed by all and we left with some seriously full bellies. We loved how all the rooms were private with garden views.
Fabulous place to experience Korean high cusine.
For anyone who wants to try traditional Korean, this is the place.

Super great food
I went there because I heard it was a good restaurant, but since it is a good restaurant, there was a wait.
However, the wait does not take several tens of minutes and goes away quickly.
The turnover rate is good, so it's good for people waiting, but it seems like people eating inside the store eat quickly rather than leisurely.
I felt like I was subtly noticing my husband, so I ate quickly and then got up and left. 🤣
The taste was as good as it is a good restaurant.
We each ordered soft tofu and extra pork belly, but the staff was saying something, but I couldn't understand what they were saying, so we ended up getting three pieces of rice even though we were both eating.
I think you said that extra rice would be served, but I think I'll have to listen carefully in that case.
If you scoop up bean sprouts, kimchi, etc. from the self-serve bar and mix it with soft tofu, it’s super delicious!!👍
It’s delicious when eaten with pork belly!👍

Released on May 1, 2021
While looking for a raw fish restaurant in Haeundae, I came across a lot of sukidashi, so I went there after seeing the food photos on a blog on Naver.
Avoid lunch with family
I don't know the view. I'll take you to the inner room.
Assorted medium order
The staff was not friendly. They threw the plates away like they were leaving Jjajangmyeon. It could be so if you're busy, but it's already past lunchtime and I'm not busy... wow~
Conclusion It's a waste to pay 110,000 won for a medium assorted meal.
When it comes to sukidashi, all you see is a photo.
The first three types of sukidashi
And the assorted sashimi comes out first.
I guess so
But time passes
After 20 minutes, did the sukidashi come out? When I asked
2 more types of sukidashi
10 minutes later
Please give me spicy stew
30 minutes later
One fried food and spicy stew
A bowl of rice costs 2000 won.
Contains less than half a container
The course meal doesn't come out this slowly either.
For now, let’s finish eating

When I look at the blog, there are abalone and grilled fish sukidashi, but they don't actually appear on the table I ordered.

So I asked after calculating the money.
Why don't you give grilled fish and abalone sukidashi to the staff?  The employee said, “If you have it, I’ll give it to you, but if you don’t have it, I can’t give it to you.” Theory
Absurd
I think this raw fish restaurant is whatever the taffy seller wants.
Wow~~
The president ate it
It seems like people give you food when you see them.
Don't play with your food.
At that price, I would buy a good meal under the Hyggely Hotel.
The worst raw fish restaurant in Haeundae!!

This restaurant have not parking lot.
Really bed point.
So minus one star.

Local people are loving sashimi with water.
If you looks strange this dishes. Don't worry. Just one bites. You will fall in love.
I was recommended this place by my Airbnb host. The 물회 here is served differently from other places as it is served dry. You can then add rice, noodles, gochujang (home-made) and/or ice and water to make bibim mulhoe, the standard mulhoe, or bimbimbap mulhoe. Tables come with instructions on how to enjoy it in the three different ways, but they're in Korean. However, if you ask for the servers to explain it to you, they seemed happy to do so (observed some guests asking for advice!). Price is a little on the steeper end, but it's raw fish at a popular restaurant so it's to be expected; even then, it's not overly expensive, and definitely worth a try.
Though we didn't read Korean, the staff looked after us, and the food was delicious. Traditional Korean style sitting on the floor.
Best sashimi in town
Delicious but it was hard to find a parking space but overall it was pretty good.

Galbitang is delicious. The store parking lot is narrow so you have to double park, but there is a public parking lot right above. The parking fee is also very low due to the low water supply. It's good to eat and take a walk around Taejongdae.
It was close to the Taejongdae parking lot and there was an Ediya Coffee Shop on the second floor, so it was easy to find from afar.
I recommend eating outside rather than inside Taejongdae Park, but I enjoyed the rib soup with rich soup here.
However, since I tend to eat sparingly, I wanted the salt to be strong from the beginning and adjusted to suit individual tastes.
Also, it was disappointing that other payment methods were limited as orders could only be made by credit card on the spot after ordering using the tablet at the table.
The bulgogi lunch special is small compared to the price and the side dishes are not that great. I think the galbitang is better.
Bulgogi Special 18,000 per person
The photo is for 2 people
The parking lot owner at the entrance to Taejongdae is friendly and kind.
There was a room, so I went there with my kids and a couple of friends, and it was even better because there was plenty of space for the kids from 5 households, so we had a delicious meal.

It is 15,000 won per person.
The side dishes are tasty and okay.
Boiled pork, soybean paste, seaweed soup, and vegetables are served.
You also get paid more for adding vegetables.
If it cost about 13,000 won, I would give it about 4.5 stars.
It is 4 stars because it costs 15,000 won.
If you eat fresh ssam vegetables and freshly wrapped boiled pork ssam, the ssambap set menu, which includes grilled fish, soybean paste stew, seaweed soup, and glossy air rice, is 15,000 won per person and is good value for money.
We accept reservations for 3 or more people and close when supplies run out, but there are a lot of customers. Depending on your personal taste, you may find the seasoning too strong.
There is ample parking space in front of the store.

The seaweed soup is delicious and the mackerel is okay, but the rice is not so good.
I was a bit disappointed with the steamed rice I made yesterday.
The taste of rice may be different.
If you go to Easy Sky, go there.
The meat is somewhere between pig's feet and boiled pork, but it really melts.

Instead of eating in Mokpo, I had lunch here. I had the oyster hanjeongsik, but the reviews were a bit harsh, so I was a little worried. I went there thinking it was a bit emotional. The food is clean and delicious. Also, I think it would be good to add a little water to the stone pot after leaving the rice and eat it with barley gulbi. The soy sauce crab sauce is delicious, the seasoning is delicious, and there's nothing unusual about it. I don't know what other people didn't like, but I'm satisfied with the story.
Beopseongpo is famous for its oysters.
It is the origin of Yeonggwang Gulbi.
If you go here, the city itself is a place to be. There are many places that sell oysters and many restaurants specializing in oysters, but I went to No.1 Restaurant because a local recommended it, and it was really good.
I had a special Korean set meal of gulbi for 100,000 won and it was good value for money. The food is delicious and comes out well. Be sure to make a reservation and visit.
Glory is gulbi
When it comes to gulbi, it’s barley gulbi!
While I was near Yeonggwang, I visited a barley gulbi restaurant.
Five people visited and ate a set meal worth 150,000 won, and we were full.
There are three types of oysters available.
Barley oysters, dried oysters, oysters
Dried oysters, 1 per person, and 1 barley oyster equivalent.

Overall, all menus are delicious.
The spacious store is convenient as it can be used as a room for each guest.
The staff are friendly and very friendly.

This is a highly recommended store.
Oh, and the parking lot is at the back!!

You can eat pork from Jeju in Yeongdo, Busan. A fun Yeongdo travel tip is to search for Jeju in Yeongdo-gu, where there are especially many Jeju people.
Although the seasoning is strong, the meat quality is good and delicious.
I wish it was a little cleaner, but overall I'm satisfied.
Since it was a good restaurant, I ordered for my family (4 people), 4 servings of raw meat, and 1 set meal. At first, I was a bit surprised by the amount of food for 4 people. One serving is 2 pieces of pork belly the size of your little finger. So a total of 8. I thought this wasn't quite right. It costs 14,000 for 120 grams per serving, but I was surprised by the amount, and the taste was nothing special.
They are kind. Since it was a little late (7:30), they sometimes grilled meat. Since there were not many customers, they grilled it once on the fire at the table next to us and then handed it over to us. They made up for what was lacking right away and the taste of Jeju black pork was not very delicious. I don't think so. It could be because I'm not hungry. The person I ate with said it was okay. I will post another review after visiting again.

I ordered packaging. I like seafood, so I ate it all the time, and eventually I ended up eating whale meat. It seems to be a food that gourmets would look for because it has so many different flavors. It looks like a mixture of boiled beef and pork fat, but has a unique aroma. Those who are not sensitive to the difference will likely feel it similar to pig's feet, but I think you will feel a clear difference if you eat it without any seasoning. It was a pleasant experience to be able to feel the difference in taste within one menu.
I go there often, and the taste is definitely different from other places. The sauce (red pepper flakes) is especially delicious, the meat is tender, and the portions seem to be larger than other places.
I said it was not okay after eating low-quality whale meat in Seoul. When I went to Busan and tasted real whale meat here, it was really savory and delicious. Personally, I liked salt better than seasoning sauce.
A place where you can taste high-quality minke whales

You could eat it like a bowl of rice, then pour in the broth and eat it like sashimi, so you could enjoy it in a variety of ways, and it tasted refreshing.
I visited this place on the recommendation of an acquaintance. It is near the entrance to Haenyeo Village and appears to be a fairly old restaurant. The tuna sashimi and rice bowl were quite fresh and the side dishes were excellent. It's a bit pricey, but it's a good restaurant. However, it was a bit disappointing that you had to take off your shoes before entering and that it wasn't a meal for one person, perhaps because of the side dishes.
Tuna raw fish and tail steak
The perfect combination
The taste and value for money are also excellent

In Busan, you can find mulhoe in Yeongdo.
The quality and cost-effectiveness of the fish are the best.
A recommended raw fish restaurant in Yeongdo

There is a lot of tuna sashimi.

Tail steak served together

I think it'll be okay
My first time eating tuna raw fish.
I was fascinated by the generous amount of tuna and radish salad.
Steak, a spicy tuna tail dish, is a delicacy.
Of all the sashimi restaurants I've been to so far, this one was the best. I've been to a lot of sashimi restaurants, but this is the first time I've had this delicious sashimi ^^ Even though it's tuna sashimi, it's not expensive and the tuna tail steak is especially delicious ^^ I have to go whenever I feel like sashimi. Absolutely delicious restaurant!!!

Our first time eating Sea salt eel with green leaf wrap. Interesting style and the sea eel were light and crunchy. Yum yum.
Friendly service and were offered free latte after meal. It warms our evening. Good restaurant with good  quality food.

Nice to try a famous dish in Busan. Tasted is pretty good. Portion was huge 1 small dish is enough for 2 person. Side dishes provided was plentiful. Service was quick compared to a bunch of people. Reasonably priced. Recommend to visit at least once to try.
Braised pork leg (Trotter) restaurant with plenty of side dishes with each main ordered.
Comes in 3 types -
Braised Pork Leg
Braised Pork Leg with fresh salad
Braised Pork leg in spice flavour.
Comes in 3 sizes, small, medium and large.

Had their original and famous braised pork. All meat are already sliced.
You might want to note there is plenty of side dishes that comes with the main dishes, so a Small serving can actually be filling for 2 pax.
Restaurant service is fast and clean.
Food is good, would be a good consideration if you’re around the area.
I stopped by and ate it about 10 years ago, and the taste has become much milder than then.  If you add mustard, you can enjoy a similar taste as before.  I had naengchae jokbal and ohhyang jangyuk, but the naengchae jokbal was more delicious.  For parking, you have to use a public parking lot, but it is quite expensive.

Local place that serves traditional stir-fried octopus and shrimps. The price on menu is for 1 person. Normal flavor is not spicy and perfect for the rice. Don’t forget to add seaweed to the rice to enhance the sweetness. The set comes with unlimited sides and cold soup. The owner is also friendly even if he doesn’t speak English.
The food was good. loved the self service side dish area. Clean atmosphere you can use the kiosk to order and pay at the table. Don’t expect any services…. I guess they were too busy all the staff were not friendly I believe it was the owner who was at the cashier It seemed like he was having a bad day…. no answering no smiling… Well but enjoyed the food
Ordered the seafood soup as it’s non spicy and it’s really good. It’s by pax so the portion was really big, I love how tender the octopus is. Crab was juicy too. Should have ordered the stir fried octopus too as it looks really good!
Good food, normal soup is not too spicy. Order by tablet and pay with card or cash at the table via tablet, but dont worry if you dont know how to use, the staff is so friendly and they will help you

I went because I was craving dumplings in the chilly weather. I don't like salty food these days, but I really enjoyed the mild dumpling hotpot!
The only thing that was disappointing was that there were people grilling meat and it was difficult because the smell of meat was all over their clothes and hair, probably due to lack of ventilation...

.
An old jokbal restaurant located in an alley in Nampo-dong.

From its name, it is a ‘special pig’s trotter’.
Pig's feet, which are somewhat special, are the signature menu of this restaurant.

Boiled so thoroughly that you can chew it with your gums.
The soft pig's feet are sliced ​​liberally.
It's unique and attractive because it's neither boiled pork nor pig's feet.

“pig’s feet”
It's a place where you don't necessarily have to go somewhere to eat, but you can eat it anywhere and the food is above average, but this is a place you really want to bring someone to eat.

The staff are quick and efficient, and are used to serving tourists. Food was great. Checkout process was smooth as well.
Order the set with pork belly cut with soup rice.  The pork belly is very soft and delicious.  Price wise is just a bit more than the local shops but we were offered the window seats watching the Main Street, so worth the money!
They know what they're doing.
Pork in broth, option 1 and Blood sausage (sundae) in broth, option 2.

Tasty soup/broth with good meaty/savoury flavour. Warming and filling. The sundae was just right. Meaty but not too overpowering with taste of blood.

Of course with all the joyful accompaniments which you can self refill for free (fantastic) if you run out.

Perfect meal for any time of day. You won't regret it.
Visited: Oct. 2022

Ordering was simple but just let one of the staff know when you are ready. Most of the staff knows little to no english. There was no wait when I came here.

The banchans are refillable and there's a station to do that. I got a meal set that had a combo of bossam (boiled pork belly) and sundae (blood sausage). It was pretty expensive so I don't know if it was due to inflation or tourism. The pork belly was quite bland and I definitely needed to eat the banchans with it. The blood sausage was okay as well and I think I should have tried it from other places to compare.

I should have just gone somewhere else.2019.7.20 18:30

2. The customer was catching flies with an electric fly swatter, but I left it alone.

3. It was clearly stated that it was a meeting place, but the linoleum mat was completely torn up, with no indication of when the floor was repaired.

4. The boss says the service is good, but he says something about not eating the food quickly at the meeting.

5. A service that greets customers at the entrance while they eat.

6. Service that throws the rice bowl while eating.
Would you like me to clean up the dishes for you? Cleaning up the dishes without saying anything

7. While I was finishing my meal and taking a quick cigarette break, the boss annoyed me by telling me to turn off the lights in the parking lot and hurry up.

You need to enter from side door of the building. The lift doesn't serve you to the entrance. So quite inconvenient as we were bringing the luggages and had the food here after reached Busan.
Location is good. Just opposite to Busan station. Staffs are friendly.
Original chesse crust pizza is very well-combination of all ingredients 👍 Cheese flavor is super rich and special.

Visit again. Their cheese is still special 👍
I always order Lee Jaemo crust pizza.
Pizza is so good.

Salad with cheese is yummy. The dress with lemon is fresh.

Risotto is way little dry!
Fantastic ""Korean style"" pizza
Not too greasy but flavorful.
Would definitely recommend.
But there's always going to be a huge queue of approx 1hr.
Would recommend to put your name on the waiting list and take a stroll nearby.
Pizza Dough is thin with good enough of topping.
You can choose pizza,spaghetti and drinks on kiosk also pay at the same time.
Most of time there is line up to seat
Food taste it depends on you, for me it was ok. Tourist area just enjoyed

Blessing Gami Restaurant in Seomyeon, Busan
This is a pub with lunch specials and the atmosphere is that of a pub, but the coffee is actually delicious.
It is a roastery cafe run by Korea’s first generation baristas.
He's an old man with white hair, but he's still passionate about coffee.
Full course light Western meal and coffee provided for just 6,000 won
Soup and salad are served first, followed by pork cutlet and rice.
The sauce made with vegetable stock is quite mild.
However, it is soft and goes quite well with pork cutlet.
I ordered hand drip coffee as an additional option, and the owner's grandfather personally made the coffee on the spot.
Even if you eat like this, it only costs 10,000 won.
Is it because I like it and do it for exercise? I have a question.
Isn’t Gami Restaurant the best light and western restaurant in the country in terms of price and service?
I visited Gami, a Western-style restaurant located near Bujeon Market in Seomyeon, with my girlfriend during the New Year holidays. I had not been able to visit before because it was closed on Sundays, but it was nice to be able to visit during this holiday.

We ordered pork cutlet (8,000 won) and hamburger steak (12,000 won). The pork cutlet was attractive with its crispy fries and less-sweet sauce, and the hamburger steak was soft and delicious.

The soup provided at the beginning of the meal was a good start with a familiar taste, and the cabbage salad was sour and delicious. Afterwards, the main menu items of pork cutlet and hamburger steak were served, and after finishing the meal, coffee and sugar were provided.

I enjoyed a rich meal in a restaurant with a retro atmosphere, and I plan to visit again next time.
It's a place that sells Western-style pork cutlets with a nostalgic coffee shop feel, and the owner is a first generation person who majored in coffee and even studied abroad in Japan, so I found out later that if you go, you should definitely try the coffee. The pork cutlet sauce has a mild taste.
I feel like I traveled to the past on a timer.
Feels like an old cafe

The pork cutlet sauce is not sweet and tastes healthy.
In the old days, I was disappointed when pork cutlet didn't come with soup, but it included soup and coffee for dessert after the meal.
The feeling of being treated with yellow pine for 5,000 won

I highly recommend it if you want a warm and comfortable meal.

The suki is just ok.

Fresh natural raw fish and a variety of dishes are always served.  Perhaps because the owner has big hands, the portion is so large that it is difficult to eat it all.  The seaweed soup as an appetizer and the anchovy soup at the end are excellent.

Jangteo is a famous restaurant with delicious crab dishes. I ordered the crab bibimbap and the crab stew which were  both delicious. I'm not sure what was in the bibimbap but my lips started to swell due to some sort of allergy that even I'm not sure of. However the crab stew was the best part of the meal and it was absolutely amazing. The crabs were so full of meat and falls apart so easily that when you put it in your mouth it just melts away from the carcass. Super easy to eat and tastes even better.
Lovely place in Mok Po city. Delicious Crab and taste is not salty. You can try mixed with white rice. Crab soup also good choice for me. Crab meat is fully charged. It's fabulous!!👏👏
Great crab flesh bimbimpap.  The side dishes were also extremely tasty with the white kimchi being really good.  I found wrapping the rice with the seafood specially good.  Would recommend to anyone who wants something uniquely local.
It was the average quality of food. Not bad but wouldn't visit again.

I went to have breakfast with a friend in September 2024. Freshwater clam soup set meal 12000w
There are only Japanese people (lol)
But it's really good for breakfast.
The radish that comes with the spicy mackerel is delicious💕It's about a 5 minute walk from the bus stop. We arrived at Busan at 8:00 a.m. by ferry from Shimonoseki and took the 5-1 bus to Nampo from the bus stop on the opposite side of the road in front of Busan Port. It's recommended because it's right next to the transfer point when going to Matsushima.
A restaurant famous for its clam soup
Open from 7am so use it for breakfast
A set meal costs just over 10,000w
The clam soup is not as salty as some other reviews say, but it is rather thin so it is better to add table salt.
Miso stewed radish and mackerel is so delicious that you can get a second helping.
The combination of freshwater clam soup and white rice will keep you eating forever.
A restaurant that will make you feel happy from the morning with a full stomach.

THE BEST FRIED RICE WITHIN 10KM RADIUS
I visited Dongwha Banjeom, a 74-year-old Chinese restaurant in Jung-gu, Busan.
Previously, I introduced a place that was good at soy sauce, jjamppong, and sweet and sour pork.
This time, it's Dongwha Restaurant, known for being good at fried rice and uni-jjajang.

Arrived at 12:00 on Saturday, and the waiting line started 20 minutes after entering.
Waiting after ordering uni jjajang and fried rice
An old gentleman dressed in a smart suit comes in.
The restaurant owner said, “Chairman, it’s been a while since you came here.”
A warm welcome. As a long-time regular at the old restaurant, my expectations soared even further.

Very friendly old lady staff
Shinda served fried rice and uni jjajang.

fried rice
There is a lot of feedback that the amount is small.
It was just right to eat all of it without leaving anything behind.

The fried rice at Dongwha Restaurant was far from what I had imagined.
I was expecting fried rice that was nicely fried and had a flying texture.
Here, the grains of rice were glossy, oily, and lightly seasoned with a savory flavor.

This place doesn't use oyster sauce, so it's not spicy.
This is the specialty of this restaurant's fried rice.

I think people's reactions will be different.
People who like noodles and people who can enjoy them even if they don't.
I had a good meal.

Unijjajang
(* Unijjajang means finely minced pork,
Jjajang (finely chopped onions and potatoes)

Dongwha Banjeom Uni Jjajang
The consistency of the sauce is similar to thick nurungji soup.
It wasn't overly seasoned and had a good umami flavor.
Moreover, the rich minced meat,
I was quite satisfied as it brought out the savory taste of Unijjajang.
It feels a little more nutty and rich than Nampo-dong Gaehwa’s Uni Jjajang?!

I only ate two menu items,
I was able to experience a subtle taste that cannot be found in Chinese restaurants these days.
Is that why the old chairman came with a driver?
I think they come here on the weekends when it is difficult to find parking.
It was said to be one of the top three Chinese restaurants in Busan and I went there because of the good reviews, but my honest review was disappointing...
Ordered Unijjajang, fried dumplings, and nanjawans, which had good reviews.

Unijjajang is okay
The fried dumplings have a bit of a burnt taste.
The first taste of Naanjawans smelled like cooked frozen food, and it was the worst Naanjawans I have ever tasted in my life!

It almost made me wonder if the people who wrote the reviews were the only ones who felt that they couldn't do it.

One of the best Kongguksu, Korean cold bean noodle, restaurant in Seoul. Dumplings and Kimchi are also great!
This is a gem when it comes to authentic Korean comfort food. Their menu is full of hearty, traditional dishes that truly warm your soul. I tried their famous Kongguksu (cold soybean noodle soup), and it was incredible—rich, creamy, and perfectly seasoned. It’s a refreshing dish that’s both satisfying and healthy.
I tried to order cold bean-soup noodles, but they're already sold out. Instead, I ordered chicken kalguksu and bibim-guksu.
It wasn't bad but  it tasted a little different from when I came here before.
The best cold bean noodles in Seoul!
At least 20-30min waiting is expected in the summer season. Their korean food is very authentic and has a nice service for the casual restaurant.
Their cold bean noodles are 14,000 KRW.
If you like spicy food, I highly recommend eating spicy noodles too. It’s a good balance of spiciness, sweetness, and sourness.
Also their dumplings are amazing too.
Very chewy and filling :)
Highly recommended!

It is said that they have been doing business here for 38 years since April 1986.

I recently moved nearby and stopped by this house by chance.
I thought I knew why it stayed here for such a long time.

The raw fish was fresh and delicious.

대방어 시즌이라 가성비 좋다는 소문을 들어 찾아갔습니다. 토요일 5시 조금 넘어서 방문했는데 거의 꽉차있었습니다. 안에 난로로 물을 데워서 실내공기를 따뜻하게 하고 있었고, 가게는 딱 들어가자마자 횟집이라는 느낌을 받을 수 있는 비린내가 났습니다.
동네 맛집이라 그런지 어르신들도 많긴했는데 분위기는 좋았습니다.(노포느낌 나긴함)
회는 방어+광어= 4만원짜리로 먹었는데 산낙지를 서비스로 주십니다. 제첩국도 원래 주시는데 사장님 혼자서 운영하시다보니 음식 나오는거나 세팅하는거나 꽤나 늦긴합니다.
적당히 천천히 즐기실 분들만 가시길..바랍니다.
회는 꽤나 신선했고 사장님도 엄청 친절하셨습니다. 밑반찬은 거의 없지만 그래도 회에 집중할 수 있고, 매운탕도 개운하니 좋았습니다.

There’s free self service coffee, water and hot soup so that’s definitely a plus. Toilet is available here.
Super yummy and refreshing noodles~ All the noodles had chewy texture, so good!

✔️ Milmyeon - Light refreshing broth to go with the chewy noodles. Once you mix the seasoning in, you get really tasty broth. Super good!
✔️ Bibim milmyeon - Dry version of the milmyeon. The seasoning is slightly different, heavier taste (seems like there’s some sesame oil, very fragrant). Stronger than than normal milmyeon, great for those who love heavy tastes!
✔️ Mandu- Delicious too! The skin is chewy, feels like they used glutinous rice flour in it. Really interesting and tasty texture. Mandu filling is good too, without fatty cuts of meat. Like!!
✔️Drinks/soup - Self help area for drink and soup. Hot broth is really good. You can get water or 3in1 coffee here. Great~
✔️ Ordering - Super high tech. They have a screen/card machine at every table for you to order and pay directly too. Convenient. The staff are friendly to help us (foreigners) navigate on this.

Definitely recommend! Thanks :)
We queued here for 2 hours but it was so worth 😍 The food is goood and came quite fast. They even have hot soup and cold water for us while waiting. Everything is ordered through koisk and was very english friendly
I don’t know why Busan is famous for Milmyeon but this place is very famous. We came here for lunch and there were a lot of customers at that time. Luckily we still got a table for two and ordered by ourselves on the machine. Food came out fast and yummy.
Parking is utter bogus, but it's the best milmyeon you can get in Busan. Absolutely delicious.

This traditional Korean restaurant was open since 1937. They serve a beef soup. But if you not eat beef intestine do not go for this restaurant. The soup was a very strong guts smell even I add a lot of sliced scallions or pepper.

Amazing barbecue pork! We figured out it’s aged after all, no wonder it tastes so intense and juice. Reasonable price and good service too, I would come back Busan again only for this pork 😆
Was introduced to this restaurant by a Korean and was not disappointed. In fact, we ordered 5 servings of pork when there were only 3 of us.

The pork belly and collar are amazing. The restaurant also provides a lot of sides for the customers.

The specialty of the restaurant would be the little shrimps that they provide as sides, which after grilling; is extremely flavorful and tasty.

Lastly, the staff in the restaurant will assist with the grilling of the meat.

The portion size is a little disappointing, but the raw fish bibimbap is of good quality.
If you order raw bibimbap, they give you loach soup.
The taste of raw bibimbap itself is good, but it has a strong savory taste because they added a lot of sesame oil. There is not that much raw fish and the amount of rice is small. Instead, they add a lot of lettuce and vegetables.
But considering the price, I'm not sure I would visit again.
Still, it’s a long-established store with an unusual feel.
I would like to try the raw fish set meal or just the raw fish on its own once.
The raw bibimbap ingredients were very fresh and delicious.
It was also nice that the basic soup came with loach soup.
Next time I go to Kkangtong Market, I want to go there again.
If you eat raw bibimbap, a small piece of loach stew comes with it.
It's a long-established restaurant and the taste is good. It's a good idea to have the elderly eat it with you.

Visited on Sunday at 13:10. The customers in front of us, four men after us, and three generations of women with a small boy were all locals. The taste is a little bland. The type that you adjust by yourself with salt and spicy miso.
It’s already been 9 years since I moved from Seoul to Busan.
It was my first time eating here and wow! I said it was the best haha
It's still delicious. Haha
I always do it occasionally haha.

I was in a hurry to eat it, so I couldn't take a photo of it looking appetizing.
If you go during lunch without a reservation, you may have to wait a long time.
The seasoning has become milder than before.
Spicy can be adjusted

Samgyetang is one of my favourite Korean soup... definitely come to Korea have to eat this soup. First time try here and not bad
All good the soup and chicken meat
Its just the service from idk owner or staffs not friendly...i wanna try ginseng liquer and they said its almost break time 3pm
I said i only drink 1 bottle... n she look like grumble.. too bad the service is like this
Never try ginseng liquer.. its good also
Highlight from me apart from the ginseng abalone(3 large abalones) chicken was their ginseng liquor. It just tastes well with the ginseng chicken soup somehow. It's a short distance from Courtyard by Marriot hotel.
We wanted to try eating Samgyetang so we were delighted when we saw the restaurant's sign as we were walking in Namdaemun Market. We were surprised that one chicken order is only for one person but still, we had one each. hahaha! To our surprise, each bowl has one whole chicken in it. We thought that it was too much at first but we were both able to eat everything nonetheless. This is the first time that I've eaten samgyetang so I have nothing to compare it with but it's delicious and the owner was really friendly.
One of the servers was rude from the beginning to the end. She almost yelled at me when I asked for rice. How should I know the rice was hidden inside the chicken?

I will not go there again. The food is decent, but the staff manes you understand very clearly that they want you to order fast and eat fast. 10 seconds after seating we were already supposed to order. Once we got a menu, we didn't have much time to decide. The menu desoen't explain what each dish contains, making it hard to decide under pressure. Only go there if you want to eat fast for cheap and already know what you want.
A typical and japanese styled buckwheat noodles. Its taste is very simple and clear in my opinion. The portion of noodles is small even to me. This is an old restaurant in Busan city. So some people like this noodles very much.

Yum, I enjoyed the dish. I ordered the basic samgyetang, nothing fancy. The food was delicious however the service was not so much. I was turned away the first time I came solo because they were closing in 50 mins? The 2nd time I got in and finished it in 30 mins!

Dining Experience @ Nampo Samgyetang.
.
Established since 1959, Nampo Samgyetang (남포 삼계탕) has been consistently serving hearty ginseng chicken soup made with fresh ingredients.
.
Ambience is rustic and casual. The brightly lit place is lined with simple wooden furnishings and minimal decor, and the atmosphere is bustling. Steam wafts through the air from bubbling stews at nearby tables, spreading a lovely fragrance that whets the appetite.
.
Service is brusque, with the elderly staff being rather grumpy. They only communicate in Korean, but you'll get by through pointing at the menu, which has English descriptions and pictures. As with most other Korean restaurants, all diners have to place 1 order each. I note that orders are quickly fulfilled, and staff clean up efficiently when diners leave.
.
Food is traditional Korean cuisine, focused on ginseng chicken soup and its variations. Ingredients are fresh, and the base soup stock is boiled for over 24 hours. Soulful and tasty, each mouthful is packed with flavour. They have a limited menu with other dishes, but these are average at best, rather lacklustre. Portions are large for individuals. Prices are slightly high, budget about KRW ₩21,000 / SGD $21 per person.
.
Loved the house signature Samgyetang / Ginseng Chicken Soup (KRW ₩17,000), which has a robust and delicious chicken broth / soup infused with ginseng, slow boiled over 24 hours, resulting in a lovely meaty savoury salty herbal sweet flavour. Garnished with a whole bone-in tender young chicken stuffed with sticky glutinous rice, soft garlic, dense Korean ginseng herbs, and crisp green onions. This carries beautiful meaty sweet savoury vegetal herbal spice starchy flavour, yum.
.
Functionally similar, the luxurious Samgyetang Jeonbok / Ginseng Chicken Soup With Abalone (KRW ₩27,000) has 2 whole added abalones. An excellent pairing, the springy dense abalones absorb the meaty savoury salty herbal sweet flavour of the broth / soup, complimenting with its natural briny salty sweet flavour.
The broth and glutinous rice form a rich texture and the chicken falls off the bone, but the flavors are lacking. Service is curt, borderline unpleasant. We asked for one portion (which IMO is enough for 3 people) for two and got weird looks from the waitress. A bit later, other staff were putting up signs in Korean that looked like they said 1 dish per person.
Gingseng chicken W17K, soup tasty but can't really smell the gingseng unless you drink the gingseng wine that is on the house. Overall, it was enjoyable having dinner inside.

Ordered a beef noodle soup but the noodles are way overcooked and lose all its elasticity. No good. The boiled beef soup is reasonable. A bit overpriced for what it offers.

Seasoned pufferfish shell is delicious
The taste is excellent
The method of cooking pufferfish inherited from parents remains unchanged.
Everyone is ruined
I also went to this place after looking at the Google ratings.
As soon as I entered, the owner apologized and said there was no frozen fish today.
Order 1 Jiri spicy stew 1 fried beef
I sensed a difference from Seungnyung that first appeared.
Soup soup.. how is this?
When you put the fried food in your mouth, it melts.. hey..
One thing I regret is,
Because the fish was not cleaned properly, I had to spit out the scales every time I ate the skin.

This restaurant is famous for its raw fish bibimbap. There are a lot of customers, but the turnover rate is good and the side dishes are delicious. Like Seoul Dawn House, the beef bibimbap comes with blood seed soup, and the blood seed soup is of good quality and delicious. The bibimbap is delicious, so I'm curious about the other menu items as well.
It’s a very delicious restaurant that even President YS used to frequent.
Overall, the menu has gone up in price.
Yukhoe bibimbap, which used to cost 13,000 won, now costs 15,000 won.
I think it's because prices are rising, but it seems like it's risen twice in a few months ^^
My child likes meat, so I ordered bibimbap and grilled bulgogi.
Personally, I feel like grilled bulgogi is expensive, but it is delicious.
Blood sausage soup served as a side dish is also good.
Parking is available at the tax office right next door on weekends.
Please note that there is a break time.

You can walk to Bosu-dong Bookstore Alley, so it's great for sightseeing.
I visited Saejinju Restaurant after a long time. Yukhoe Bibimbap and Seonjiguk were delicious. All the side dishes were delicious, so I ate them all^^

Ask them to separate the sauce from the Tang Su Yuk to maintain the crispness.
It was my worst meal here in my Korea trip from Singapore. I don't do reviews but this place was so bad that I had to do one.

We ordered fried rice which cost 9000 won and the portion was terrible. IT WAS SO LITTLE… I had never ate such a little portion that was so pricey. I ate with my childrens and we ordered a total of 4 plates. The whole dining experience was really bad and we just wanted to finish the food and leave the place immediately. The lady boss is also very impatient and the service and attitude was not good at all.

Really don’t recommend to come here to eat.
Noodle served in cold and wasn’t tasty. Fried bread prawn was overcharged(not on the menu so we didn’t know it was more than 30,000 won!!! And It was super greasy. Not recommended

Great experience, courses are coming in and coming out all the time, bibimbap, using soup, fried shrimp, among others. Fresh tuna, and lots of sides dishes, totally worthy. Pics don't do justice, food was great and so the service :)

Complimentary side dishes are provided before the meal.
❤️My favorite dishes is TTUCKBOKKI with Fried Set (Spicy rice cake with deep fried dumpling). MUST TRY!!!
We went in for family dine in to try Korean dishes. I love the overall experience. Food was really good in taste n presentation. They offered the kimchi with other 4 complementary starter, we finished it up before arrival of ordered ones 🤪
We ordered Gim Bap, Dolsot Bibim Bap, Jab Che and Seafood Stew.
Seoul garden is an interesting place. I do like the vibe although the atmosphere and decor is a little outdated.
The food is authentic and the taste and quality is decent overall for the price. My only recommendation would be the staff that serve the food seem to lack customer service skills and their level of enthusiasm seems non existent. As a regular customer it sometimes feels like they don't want to even serve the food. A service with a smile is always a good thing.
Overall I would recommend.
I love the Korean feels, we went on a Sunday night it wasn't crowded.. Food was delicious, we ordered seafood jeon, kimchi jiggae and half half chicken.. side dishes were also tasty and the service was fast.. we spent 185aed in total.. i'd recommend for korean food lovers 💜🫶🏻

This is a place where I always come here to eat delicious food at a good price.
Personally, I like shrimp and ribs.
A great side dish combination to eat with meat.
The beef and red pepper paste served when ordering soybean paste stew and rice is the signature of this restaurant...
Best value for money, best meat quality, and best food!!
Soybean paste is a must in this house!! It's good because there is no break time. I think you can park on a nearby road or alley. If you avoid lunch or dinner time, you can enjoy a leisurely meal~^^
The special soybean paste stew and bibim seasoning were delicious.

Both the boiled pork and sundae were excellent in taste. A bowl of soup costs 9,000 won, which has gone up a lot, but it's still delicious.
Since I'm from Busan, I've been to restaurants that are said to be good at noodle soup, and I think this place does it the best. I highly recommend it. The soup is very light.
The proprietress was very kind and helped us season the food right after it was served. We had pork and offal soup with rice, which cost 9,500 won.
It’s so satisfying to eat, and it will definitely be even better if you try it in a pot in winter.
It's my first time living in Busan and seeing boiled meat like this! A soup restaurant near Bupyeong Market that comes with colorful vegetables! Anyone who sees the boiled pork baekban for the first time, which comes with dried radish, seasoned bean sprouts, and stir-fried kimchi, gasps! Wouldn’t it be a visual with sound? There are parts that make me feel like King Lee!! The boiled pork was mixed with pork belly and various pork parts, and it was especially fun to eat with vegetables. The beef bone broth served in an earthen pot that came with it was so rich and savory that you could taste it without seasoning, so it was great!💗
Only the parts of meat with the right combination of fat and lean meat were so soft that it reminded me of soju, but I came here just to have a hearty meal!! I suppressed my desire to drink a little with cider, and the feeling of my whole body warming up when I drank a pot of soup was similar to the effect of drinking alcohol, so I did my best to take care of my body.🥰 I don't like the rice served rolled up, thanks to the menu consisting of a side dish of soup and rice in addition to 100 pieces of boiled pork. Perfect for me too!
Since all menus are made separately from soup, people who like soup served with rolled rice may have different preferences, so keep this in mind!
If you want to warm yourself up with hot soup, look for it in the alley near Bupyeong Market😳🔥
It's so delicious. It's a little far from the market, but it's a good idea to come here. It's not spicy or strong, and they're friendly.

Delicious sashimi bibimbap made by old Korean old ladies. Usually you can get pretty busy and you have to make reservations. I went on Wednesday lunch and we still can get tables for five adults and a baby stroller.

The sashimi Bibimbap was pretty fresh and taste really good.

The place seems old and small, but the food is really traditional, and you might be surprised.
Our tour guide recommended this place to us so we came to try it. I personally don't eat raw fish so my bf ordered a one person set. He liked it and said it was fresh and delicious. The staff was so kind they gave me some fish soup for free since I don't eat sashimi. The flavor of their side dishes and soup were not quite there but fish were Def fresh.
Very nice raw fish taste. Shop staff cannot speak English but no problem since there is a menu with picture.
Went to the popular myungmul sashimi place.  Sashimi is served per person unlike any other korean hwe places. We ordered the “35k won per person” meals and the highlight was the soup!!! This is not your everyday free soup, for me the soup was more delish than sashimi. Apparently they refill it for you for free if you ask ( i didnt know)

I recommend this place to visitors or if you are traveling without a local guide. As you see in the “jagalchi fish market” right across from this place, you will need lots of bargaining if you were to try sashimi from regular korean places.

My hypothesis is that this restaurant is for japanese tourists? Or japanese inspired serving style!

I would pay the price to avoid whole “bargaining” process but if i had a local guide (like my family) i would probably find a cheaper place?

Namdaemun Market: A Chaotic Yet Rewarding Experience

Namdaemun Market, one of Seoul's oldest and largest traditional markets, offers a unique and bustling shopping experience. While it's a popular destination for locals and tourists alike, opinions on it vary.

Pros:

Wide Variety of Goods: From clothing and electronics to food and household items, Namdaemun Market offers an extensive range of products.

Bargaining Opportunities: The market is known for its competitive prices, and visitors can often bargain for better deals.

Authentic Korean Experience: Exploring Namdaemun Market provides a glimpse into the everyday life of Koreans and their shopping habits.

Cons:

Crowded and Chaotic: The market can be extremely crowded, especially during peak hours, making it difficult to navigate and shop comfortably.

Limited English: Many vendors may not speak English, which can make communication challenging for foreign visitors.

Quality Variations: While the market offers a wide variety of products, quality can vary, and it's important to inspect items carefully before purchasing.

Overall:

Namdaemun Market is a fascinating place to explore, but it's important to be prepared for the crowds and potential challenges. If you're willing to navigate the chaos and enjoy the bargaining experience, you might find it a rewarding and memorable visit. However, if you prefer a more relaxed shopping experience, you might want to consider other markets or shopping malls in Seoul.
This place is out of the world, it’s so huge and have so many small small shops around. Authentic Korean restaurants there. Yon can find nice clothing, household goods around. Once you come out from the Seoul station, you will see a bridge opposite, walk on the bridge and half way you will see the market on your left. Very close to the Seoul station only 15 minutes walk.
Big market. Lots of vendors are selling similar stuff. Nobody is pushy,  in fact friendly. I spent a good amount of time walking around . Street food is also available.
The noodle alley, hotteok and all the goods you can find here. Definitely one of the biggest market in Seoul that you can explore. Some stores are closed on Sunday. So to get the full experience out of your visit, avoid Sundays is you can.

Suyuk : Boiled Beef or Pork Slices
Atmosphere like an old restaurant
It is not the rich and spicy style commonly known as Yukgaejang, but is said to be a title unique to the family.
Mild and soft beef stew is unfamiliar yet comfortable.
It is inhaled. However, in terms of cost-effectiveness, it is so-so.
In general, it would not be easy to judge this dish as Yukgaejang before trying it.

However, it has a moderately deep and mellow flavor.
Perhaps because I ate it as a hangover, I felt a strange charm of it being mild and not spicy.
There is a reason why it has endured for 60 years.

It's worth trying at least once.
A lot of elderly people come here.
Maybe that's why it's not irritating and goes away easily.
One thing that is disappointing is that the refill amount for side dishes is too small.
The rice was yellow and mushy, as if it had been a few days old.

The soup tastes like it's almost ready to rest.

I changed the rice because it was weird, but it's just a little better, but it's weird.

I ate 2 spoons and put it down.

The beef is the most delicious I have ever had for Korean barbecue. They have a menu in English if you need it and even a QR code for only menu. The service is great. I would highly recommend any foreigners and locals to eat here.
Expensive and service is not that good. The server recommends the most expensive set. Portions are little. Side dishes are mostly sour. 1 set of meat cost around 20 to 25k. Pictures are for 3 sets. Not recommended for big eaters
We had a great meal here.
Yes, a little expensive, but the food was great and service excellent. They showed the local ways to eat the food with a friendly smile.
If you're looking for an all you can eat buffet to stuff yourself with, this probably isn't your place, but if you want some quality food and to leave satisfied, I'd highly recommend it.
We ordered 3 different meat dishes and 3 small cold noodle dishes for a group of 3. It was perfect!!
The food quality is good, but not really worth the high price.

Since it was in front of my house, I thought it would be nice to have a drink and walk, so I kept going, but it closed early so I couldn't go 😂 It tastes good! But it seems like it's a tourist restaurant, so it's all locals!
I visited after a year.
It was nice to change from sitting indoors to standing and not having to take off your shoes.
The flounder raw fish is still the best.
The side dishes that came with it were good, and the raw fish served with rice at the end was good.
It's a delicacy.
The regular price of flounder mulhoe is 8,000 won and the special price is 10,000 won.
Prices have risen a lot compared to before, but...
It's still a satisfactory place, and it's a place I definitely go to whenever I visit the East Sea.

This is a great after-hours grub spot that serves all the way until sun up. An expansive menu to choose from, every dish we had was impeccable.

If you're coming from a heavy drinking session, I'd recommend the amazing budajigae (Korean army soup). It is well worth it and will ensure you no hangover the next day.
Food was really good. Serving was big too and the sides were refillable, even the lettuce so it was worth it.

I wanted to give it 4 stars only because it could have has more options in the menu.  But the owner was really friendly/nice.
The plates weren't washed thoroughly. The table was a bit sticky. I can understand you're busy on weekends but this is not an excuse. The food is a bit ok thou.

I waited 30 minutes to get in just before 2pm on a Saturday. The side dishes were delicious and the stone pot rice was also very delicious.
The owner who served me was very quick and kind.   Grilled fish is crispy without any fishy smell
A restaurant where you can wait even for 20,000 won
Highly recommended
I ate after waiting for 30 minutes.
Two of us went, but we wanted to eat a variety of fish.
I ordered 3 servings.
Crispy and savory grilled fish
I had a good meal
Even though it was busy, they served us kindly.
I was able to eat comfortably.
I went to the Yeongwol 5-day Market, a famous grilled fish restaurant, and searched for it. The food is delicious, and the staff and the owner are all friendly, and the smiles that make you feel comfortable seem to make the food even more delicious. It's far from home, but I want to visit often when I have time.
It was my first time going to Yeongwol, and this house was the first memory I had of Yeongwol. There were already 10 people waiting 15 minutes before opening time, so my husband decided to give up, but we waited until the end to eat while looking around for a while. Two adults and a six-year-old child ordered grilled food for three people, but the baby ate the dolsot rice and scorched rice so well that it would have been insufficient if we had ordered two servings haha.
The grilled fish was basic and even the side dishes were all delicious. If you were selling salted squid, I wanted to buy it.
2023.07.17Visit
If I go to Yeongwol, I'll go there again
There is no need for fish with freshly cooked stone pot rice.
The food is delicious and they are very friendly.
For 2 people, mackerel is served in Imyeonsu.
For 3 people, Lim Yeon-soo's mackerel, cutlassfish, and flounder are served.
2 people ordered 3 servings.
The quantity is really big.
Usually, for 2 people, you can just order 2 people.
I went for lunch on a weekday, but there was a wait even after I got in.
You may have to wait a long time because they take your order and cook it for you.

The owners are a Korean couple and everything they serve is fresh and delicious. The side dishes tasted the same back in Korea even the samjang (bean paste). The veggies and meat are fresh. Kimchi-jjigae was served piping hot and had somkuch flavor.

Service is top notch. We waited for a bit to get a table. Our server cleaned everything and brought us a new grill. We enjoyed out dinner and our soju.

We highly recommend this place! If you wanted to try Korean food and if you want to take a break from Thai food as well.
Grilled with good quality meat, very delicious. 😋😋 I've been here many times. There are many kinds of drinks. But the air conditioning is a bit cold because I'm a person who is easily cold.😅
I went to booboosikdang a little late at the end of the year.
The clean atmosphere and the kindness of the owner and staff were nice.
I ordered pork neck & pork belly set, soybean paste stew, and tteokbokki.
Unlike other Korean restaurants in Thailand, they served with thick raw meat. And the meat was soft and delicious as rumored.
The soybean paste stew was also clean and very delicious with red pepper. (a little spicy)
However, the tteokbokki was different from what I had expected, with its appearance and texture, and crucially, the taste was not good.
Two children aged six and eight and the couple visited, and the portion was just right and not too much to eat.
Went there yesterday in view of the good review and is not disappointed at all. We had the set for two and the food quantity is good enough for three persons. The meat is fresh and you can refill the vegetables and the condiments. Staff is very attentive and helpful. Place is tidy and clean and so far is the best place for Korean pork belly BBQ in Chiangmai. It is highly recommended
Definitely recommend this restaurant if you're craving Korean food or something non-Thai. We especially liked the banchan (side dishes) and they are re-fillable. The fried chicken comes in two sizes, M (200g) and L (400g). Unlike traditional bulgogi, which is stir fry, the soy sauce bulgogi here was more of a gravy. However, the flavour was really nice so I would get it again. The service was also friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be coming back to try the other things on the menu.

It is a restaurant in Dongjak and Kkachiul Station that has been in business for a long time in one place! The dumpling casserole made with homemade rolled dumplings is really spicy and honey delicious! It's spacious and comfortable inside, the owner is friendly, and there's delicious pizza and cute rabbits, so it's a great place for kids. Recommended as a family restaurant in Bucheon!!
Since it was a rolled dumpling, it was full of filling and the dumpling skin was thin, so it was delicious! And I liked it because it went better with the spicy broth and wasn't greasy :)
It's the best restaurant in Bucheon. I've never had dumplings as delicious as this one. You have to order the dumpling casserole because it goes down so easily and doesn't bite you. It's a great way to end the day by eating such a hearty and delicious dinner. I'll come back often, boss^^

Shrimp is also delicious.
The abalone and braised ribs were all delicious.

Home garden feel
There are many bonsai pots in the garden, so it's nice to look around. There were a lot of autographs as many famous people came, and it seems like a lot of them appeared on TV as well.

The price was not cheap, but it was worth it.
There is no separate dessert, but there is an Americano coffee machine so you can drink it ^^

I couldn't take a good picture because I was eating it haha.
I added it after construction~~It's neat~The pot rice is delicious.
The yard of Dolsoebonga is full of wild flowers and bonsai, and there are so many things to see that I feel like my eyes are being purified^^
But the food was expensive and the taste was a little worse than 2 years ago~~
A house worth visiting at least once. Stone pot rice and braised ribs are okay!!

One menu, a delicious soup served with the best kimchi i ate in my life. I used to go there when my husband’s friend was drunk. The soup is very good when you woke up from hangover 😂
There is a lot of meat here and it is really delicious. The price is a bit high, but hehe.
As expected, Seoul kkakdugi is hearty.
Kkakdugi and kimchi are also delicious ^^
Seoul Kkakdugi is a seolleongtang restaurant that everyone in Busan knows. The main branch is located in Nampo-dong, and there are no stores except the main branch and Jeonpo branch, so be careful about similar business names.

Please note that the Nampo-dong main branch is currently under construction by demolishing the existing building and is scheduled to open around November 2022.

This is my first visit to the Jeonpo branch due to construction at the main branch, and the fragrant smell of oil fills my nose as soon as I enter the store. You can see the face of an employee at the Nampo-dong main branch. Without hesitation, I order seolleongtang. The table setting was nothing special, and cabbage kimchi and radish radish were served.

A dozen years ago, there was a jar of kimchi on every table, and you could eat as much as you wanted from there. Currently, it is served on a separate plate, and additions can be made at any time.

Seoul Kkakdugi’s kkakdugi and cabbage kimchi are not spicy at all. It feels cool with a subtle sweetness. It doesn't feel burdensome to eat on its own, and it's the perfect accompaniment to oily seolleongtang.

A bowl of seolleongtang costs 13,000 won. There was a time ten years ago when the price was 9,000-10,000 won, but looking at the current menu makes me feel the passage of time. However, even at the current price, it is worth the money. The beef is a mix of Korean beef and Australian beef, and is boiled so thoroughly that it melts right into your mouth. Seolleongtang comes with rice and somen noodles as standard, and if you feel like you don't have enough rice, you can just add some rice and eat it.

The hall is large and has many seats. There is also relatively ample parking space in front of the store.

They are friendly and the Korean beef tastes good. I went to eat Korean beef raw fish, and the portion was huge. It tastes good because it's cow Korean beef, and the broth doesn't have the pungent vinegary taste that comes from raw fish restaurants, but it's just right, sweet and slightly spicy. I guess they make the broth with water mixed with red pepper powder, but the broth also has a clean taste. It would be better if you could control the sourness a bit.
I don't know if the meat served is cow, but it looks like good meat. The side dishes that come out also look good. I especially liked the Myeongnamul namul, which was large in size but not tough. The Korean beef raw fish was also better because I used medium noodles.
The meat is really delicious. It seems like there are more customers since it was broadcast on TV. The raw meat is really soft and the noodles are delicious. It is a great place for a company dinner as it has a spacious room. The staff are also friendly
Sticking to the basics... Gently recording the flowers.

Traditional restaurants in Busan
Quiet private room... Suitable for most gatherings... Yuki Course (100,000)
It is one of the largest and most traditional Japanese restaurants in Busan. The taste of the food and the taste of raw fish was good, but the overall composition was a bit old, perhaps due to the restaurant's insistence on its own tradition. I think it would have been better not to have served the crab meat sushi at the end.

Extremely overpriced. The meat had lots of fat that was not tasty.
The bread was delicious, the steak was plain, the sauce was delicious, and the T-bone steak I had before was very delicious.

Need to find a place to park nearby.
Crazy value for money
The price and quantity of sweet and sour pork make it feel like they are selling it at a loss.
The crispiness of the sweet and sour pork was over the limit, but it was also full of gravy.
A taste that makes you want to eat it with just salt
This is my first time trying a soy sauce with so much live onion in it.
The sauce seems lacking, but is not lacking at all.
If you order soy sauce, they give you jjamppong soup.
It's either a squid... or a small scale... and the clam meat is alive.
I don't see any frozen products made in China at all.
I was very satisfied and I recommend it to all my friends and family.
I think of this every time I eat sweet and sour pork in my life.
Sweet and sour pork that you have to try at least once!!
Crispy, not crunchy.
I hope you will be satisfied with the Jjamppong soup service.
The inside of the store has an old feel.
This place is famous for specializing in sweet and sour pork. I visited the restaurant and ate it, and the sweet and sour pork was really crispy and delicious. And the portion size was so large that I had to eat it midway through to take it away. Jjamppong soup and fried dumplings were also provided as a service, which were also really delicious. I also ordered soy sauce and fried rice, and it was surprisingly delicious. The downside is that there is no parking lot, so you have to park separately for a fee, and the inside of the store is small and dirty, and there are mosquitoes, so the atmosphere is bad, but the prices are cheap and it's delicious, so I recommend it.

A nostalgic sweet and sour pork restaurant next to an old high school.

It's a place you come to for memories, but for those who come here without memories, the sweet and sour pork is so crispy that it will irritate the roof of your mouth.

I have seen this place from Market Kurly. 갈비탕(Beef Short Rib Soup, Galbitang) is main and popular food in this restaurant. Staff is very kind and friendly. Food was very good as well. There is a parking lot next to this restaurant and they pay parking lot fee for a customer. I highly recommend this restaurant.
No service at all. You have to grill the beef by  yourself cuz there are too limited number of staff. The quality of Korean beef is good but definitely not worth for this price. It would be make-sense if the price is at least halved for the quality of food and service. You must have better experience if you have beef in fukouka or any other places. I definitely not recommend this place, which is expensive and have no service.
The servers upsell HARD at this restaurant and give you attitude if you aren't ordering much.

Once we told the lady we wanted to try their barbecue she kept pointing at the most expensive course available, which by itself, is arguably fine, however, once she realized we aren't going to order much of the expensive meat her attitude changed and kept walking away mid-cooking as soon as someone/something else requires her attention (and at times just drop the tongs at the table like she is sick of serving us).

The meat we ordered was completely burnt on one side and we definitely had better experiences eating at other (cheaper) restaurants.

The locals around us all order soups which require no server's attention so I would suggest trying that if you really really want to try this place..
Parking : convenient.
Price : relatively Expensive considering the quantity
Taste : good
Service : midium

Overall....
If you don't care about the budget or just eat Galbitang not barbeque, this is the place where you can eat quality korean barbeque and Galbitang, side dishes are also fine.

But if you consider cost effectiveness and worry about the budget and want to get what you pay for, there are lot's of better options around this place. It's expensive.

A collaboration of sweet yet sour kimchi and thick lean meat.

It's been quite a while since Seong Si-kyung appeared on I'll Eat It, but
A house that still waits.

It's nothing special, but I still think about Sokcho Country Restaurant from time to time.
A house that became famous thanks to Seong Si-kyung.
Duruchigi restaurant. Give up eating at restaurants
I ate it as a takeout and it was delicious.
However, it is not something you would go out of your way to eat.
If you look carefully, you can find a taste even in your neighborhood.
Anyway, it's a lot and it's one of the best Duruchigi I've ever eaten.
I'm sure it's top tier.
This was a restaurant featured on Seong Si-kyung's ""I'll Eat It"" menu, so it was more delicious than I expected. First of all, the owner seems to be good at cooking.

Not only the Duruchigi but also all the side dishes are delicious. However, there seems to be some likes and dislikes about the old-fashioned soybean paste stew. Recommended for those traveling to Sokcho.
The duruchigi and side dishes are delicious. However, if you ask why you have to stand in line at 7:30 to eat, I have nothing to say.

Braised crab? Just looking at the menu, it looks delicious.
In reality, it looks like crab stew is made by simmering it in broth, just like making soybean paste stew with strong soybean paste.

It's a famous crab soup restaurant, so I went in through an introduction. But I ordered braised crab;; Is it to suit the tastes of young people? It was a bit sweet. I discovered after finishing eating that there was a half bath. Next time I go again, I'm going to try crab soup.
The crab braised sweet and salty is delicious^^
It tastes better when you eat rice and add potatoes to it ^^
I like the steamed crab meat because it is firm and the seasoned broth is delicious.

I visited Seomyeon while looking for a place where I could have an early meal before 11:30.

The chawanmushi that came out first was so cold that I was disappointed.

The salmon rice bowl did not have soy sauce on top, but rice seasoned with furikake was placed underneath the salmon, which did not suit my taste.

My group ate sea squirt bibimbap, but although I didn't try it, it had a really good flavor.

I ordered 20,000 won regular sushi instead of the 30,000 won special sushi, and it was ordinary.
I went to see the Google rating.
I searched for sushi around the main branch of Lotte Department Store in Busan.
The rating is not good. I thought I would give it a try at least if it was 3.8, so I went there.
Ordered 50,000 courses. The taste of the food is neither strong nor weak,
It was a perfect fit. Assorted raw fish was also served, and on that day, wild flounder was served.
I had a chance to taste it.
Sajingnim (chef) personally prepared the main dish and gave detailed information about the food.
You have a philosophy.
Owner’s philosophy_+ Food must be made honestly+
These words resonated with me. Since it keeps getting swept away, it feels like a promotion for the store.
Reduce it to this point.  100% repeat visit.
Had 100,000 won courses
Worth it
Parents loved it
Many unique dishes.
I was surprised to see rare dishes that I couldn't find at the raw fish restaurants I usually go to.
This was my second visit and I am very satisfied.
The server explained each dish in detail.
50,000 won sushi course. Normal.

It was very delicious and I would definitely visit again if I ever come to Dongne, but I think I would hurry and get there earlier than opening time.
It was a bit disappointing that the herbal medicine scent wasn't strong, but the noodles were chewy and had a nice red pepper powder scent, so it was delicious. The dumplings have a slightly thin skin, but they have pickled radish inside, so they have a good chew.
The dried noodles are delicious. It has a clean taste without any unnecessary elements. The kneading, water, bibim, and dumplings are all delicious.
If you massage it, it's great.  It's really delicious. I highly recommend it. Be sure to stop by.
It runs from 10:30 to 18:00.
If two or more people go. On the noodles. Adding king dumplings is a must. lol
The photo shows the current price list as of May 2024
It closes at 6 o'clock. I went a little after 5 o'clock, took a number, and waited, but those who came later had to just turn back.
I couldn't order bibim wheat noodles due to running out of ingredients. I ordered kneading noodles and water, but they were all available.
It's delicious..

Great service and experience in Madang restaurant every time I visit. Love the positive atmosphere and very attentive staff. Food is so delicious and so many choices. I always go for the BBQ love the experience and taste. Also rice cakes are must! Everything is so delicious and my vegetarian friend had also so many options!
Madang serves up delicious food with generous portions at great prices. The staff are friendly, attentive, and always ready to make sure you have a great dining experience. Shoutout to Jenesis and his team for the fantastic service – keep it up! We’re hoping to see a Madang branch in Abu Dhabi downtown soon!
•Madang is a great Korean restaurant with delicious barbecue. It’s my second favorite Korean barbecue spot in Abu Dhabi. The meat is flavorful and definitely a highlight, but the side dishes included with the barbecue could use some improvement. A wider variety or more attention to those side dishes would really enhance the overall experience.

•The service is very good, and all the staff deserve congratulations for their great work! Sometimes there’s a delay with some of our requests, but that’s okay. They are always friendly and attentive. The place is spacious and features a Korean theme, and you have to remove your shoes to sit, which creates a great atmosphere.

•We ordered the Korean Barbecue Marinated (299 AED), and as I mentioned, the meat is good, but the side dishes could be improved. That said, we can still say that the overall experience is enjoyable.
[Prices from October/2024]

•We might come back. We appreciate their barbecue and the experience.

Madang Korean Restaurant offers an authentic experience with its flavorful dishes and vibrant atmosphere. The menu features different traditional Korean favorites. The service is generally attentive especially most of employees are Filipinos. Ms. Lyn is the one who accomodate us. The setting is casual yet cozy.

I went to eat soybean paste and the onions were fresh. I only ate soybean paste here. The lady who owns it seemed to have a nice personality. If I eat more than two noodles, I want to try the sweet and sour pork.
This is not a place to just grab a meal, but a place to enjoy proper Chinese food. I had a course meal, and the ingredients were fresh and the food wasn't overly seasoned, which was nice. However, the unfortunate thing is that the room has a collapsible wall between the rooms, so the noise from the next room can be heard so clearly that the advantage of the room is overshadowed. That was a bit disappointing. Still, the plates were replaced for each meal, and I was satisfied with the service.
The quantity is plentiful and the taste is good.
The food is a little sweet.
A popular Chinese restaurant frequented by local residents.
I am posting a taste of pickled cabbage before a meal.
Cantonese Sweet and Sour Pork (Bumuk Style) The glutinous rice dough was chewy and the finely sliced ​​cucumbers had a good texture.

If you go there, there are various Korean menus and side dishes.

You can choose according to your taste. There were drinks and desserts, so I ate in moderation and left with a clean stomach. Also, there were several types of soups and soups, and since it was based on a wedding buffet, the quality was a little better than other Korean buffets.

And of all the Korean buffet places I've been to, this one is amazing because it's large and a movie is played on VimPro in the dining room, so we enjoyed our meal.

And since a lot of people around the market come to eat, it's a good idea to set aside some time to come in.

The taste was good, the location was good, and there were a lot of options.

Additionally, this place also provides takeout lunch boxes, so if you need anything to pack after eating, you can ask the staff.

If you are a foreigner, there is a new law for Australia that took effect August 18, 2024 that all foreigners must show a passport to get a membership card, and you must have a membership card to gamble. You can enter the casino and just look around without a passport however. Very nice casino, much better than most you would find in Las Vegas.
Went here to play some Blackjack having come from another city. You are required to sign up for a Star Casino membership to play any games which is a pain in the rear and the process takes a while.

The Blackjack tables were $100 - $200 minimums which is a little excessive. They had cheaper tables of a Blackjack variant called Blackjack Challenge...there are some extra rules that advantage the player but those advantages are completely wiped out by the fact that you lose your wager on a push with the dealer. The majority of tables were for this game for obvious reasons, way higher house edge.

Unless you have a lot of money to put on the table for regular Blackjack, I wouldn't bother because Blackjack challenge isn't worth it, house edge is too high.

Also didn't like how the dealers at the tables just throw your membership card at you once they swipe it. Placing it down in front of me would be a lot more pleasant than it being tossed at me.

Other than that the casino itself was clean, tidy and well laid out.
The staff from the valet parking team, the checkin, and the Harvest welcome team. you are the most friendly and helpful team in any hotels we have been to around the world. the staff is on par with the Sands resort in Singapore. thank you to the amazing team. you made our short stay great.  Our room is comfortable and a good size for a couple.
I enjoyed the convenience of the location. My only real question is on the set up of the bathroom/toilet. I'm not convinced how you would feel using the loo here very early on in a relationship. I know sharing is caring, but there are some things you probably don't need your partner hearing 😆💩. Other than that...it was very nice.
Very overpriced for the value. Not sure how it qualifies as a 5 star hotel. The location was very convenient for the theater but there are no benefits to using the local restaurants or facilities. The curtin in my room was broken and I woke up to sun beaming in my face. Also advised the hotel we were travelling for a birthday and didn’t receive a card or anything. Staff aren’t around to chat just check you in and into the next.

Maru Japanese Restaurant hidden in the club house of Abu Dhabi City Golf Club, in my opinion, is by far the best Japanese, Korean experience of what great authentic Asian food is, that I have experienced in the UAE..

I have travelled extensively throughout the world  including Korea, Japan and many other Asian countries, and you’ll get that food experience at Maru.

It’s your ‘hole in the rock type of restaurant, where good food is affordable with a beer or glass of wine or Saki!’ And family friendly or with a group of friends to stay and enjoy till late..

It’s hard to choose which dish is the best as there are many options for all, down to your Korean fried chicken, however, if I was to choose, it would be seafood soups, rolls of sushi….

If you are looking for 5 star level of good food that is affordable and accessible to all.. come to Maru! Family owned restaurant, Johnny the owner will surely look after you..
Don't miss it! The BEST Korean chicken in Abu Dhabi 😋
Honestly, I can’t express my disappointment!!

My family and I used to love this place and we loved sushi because of them,
This was maybe 7 years ago when we lived in Abu Dhabi.
We came back for a visit and returned to our favourite place which we unfortunately found out to be totally a different quality and service ( too slow)

Service was very very very slow, we thought the outcome would be exceptional, however it was very disappointing.
Not fresh at all !
The service is really great. Friendly staff and very helpful.
The food is really good 👍🏻 we had the sushi boat, chicken katsu, and other plates. Very well done 👏

Their samgyetang is by far the most delicious one I have had. Samgyetang is a traditional Korean soup. It uses young chicken stuffed with rice and cooked with ginseng, jujube and garlic. I think it's similar to a rice porridge.

This restaurant was full of people and we waited for a few minutes for a table on the 2nd floor. The samgyetang was served in this piping hot clay bowl. The chicken was literally falling off the bone. The porridge has so much flavor and gets tastier with a few drops of sesame oil.

It's been a while since I visited. There were a lot of people because it was a Friday evening. It was my first time eating on the second floor.
This is a place where you can take off your shoes and sit on a chair and eat (same on the 1st and 2nd floors), and group seating is also available.
Before, I only ate monkfish jjim, but this time I ate cod pollack jjim. It was a bit spicy and had a strong scent of ash powder and sanscho (Japanese pepper), which the staff emphasized at the beginning.
The basic side dishes come with chive pancakes, salad, geotjeori, and japchae, all of which are delicious, but the Caesar salad was too good for my taste. When they refilled the side dishes, they put them in new bowls, which was good for cleanliness as well😄
There aren't as many bones as I thought, so I think it would be easier to eat them by removing a few of them at first. Two people ate the beef and we were very full. And the rice is priced separately!! There is a paid parking lot right next to it. It's free if you bring your parking ticket and get it stamped when paying. Be sure to bring your parking ticket.
I plan to visit again next time!

Negmyun (냉면) is a popular cold noodle dish that Koreans love to eat. The long chew noodles need to be cut before eating and might seems unusual to foreigners.

This is a popular local spot. Well known to the locals for having an especially spicy sauce.

When ordering (냉면)
1. Mul-Negmyun (물냉면): This comes without the spicy sauce but they have jars of it on the table. This allows you to decided how spicy it will be.
2. Bibim-Negmyun (비빔냉면): This will come will a helping spoon full of spicy sauce and less of the cold broth. Also very delicious and a veey popular order.

Don't ever try this
It's fascinating REAL KOREAN SPICY!!! The price is quite reasonable and the quality of the food is awesome. The food itself, it seems like simple but tasteful enough. If you try to enjoy the real spicy I recommand u to be there. YES SPICY BUT REALLY NICE.

The steak 🥩 cooked well and same as the side dishes. Ted Kim is the service staff to serve the steak to us. Well explanation and excellent service. The meal cost about 350,000won with a bottle of red wine for a family of five.
I went to Outback with my wife, because it was an anniversary.
I had a beef steak(sirloin) with side dishes, and those were of good quality.
I have generally satisfied with friendly staff and delicious foods.
Especially, compared to VIPS, I think It is much better than.
Food is good I'm just a little bit deceived there's no beef fillet on the menu (or flank for example).
Outback is one of the most fantastic restaurants in the world. Many kinds of steaks, pastas, and salads are on Outback’s menu. The steaks are very delicious, and the pastas are very good but the salads are not my style. One of the side dishes, mushroom soup, is very warm and tasty. Even though the restaurant was built a long time ago, the interior is still clear and nice. The dishes are served very slowly, but the staff is very kind The price of the food at the restaurant is not expensive for my family. I would recommend those who want to eat delicious steaks, pastas, and salads and to go your family
Outback steak house is one of the best restaurants in my city, Busan. Many kinds of steaks and many side dish like breads and pastas dishes are in menu. The steaks are certainly perfect and the flavors are really nice. One of the side dishes, pre-dinner bread is great. And pastas are also good too. Although the restaurant is in a high building, the interior is not too bad. The dishes served little lately, but staffs are pretty kind. The price is absolutely not cheap, but it isn't too burdensome. This restaurant is worth expecting great taste and service, and visitors will have the best aesthetic experience.

Korean beef soup place around Gyodae station in Seoul. The taste of beef soup is just about average comparing with other similar restaurant in Seoul. You can find a parking space in front.

Although business is good, customer service is also good.
The meat is really delicious! The thick meat is grilled so it's easy to eat, so all you have to do is eat it. It's very convenient.
However, the price is a bit expensive compared to the quantity.
To be honest, I just visited the new restaurant after the previous Chobeol Samgyeopsal restaurant, but I personally didn't like the meat for the price. I think the service of grilling meat is good, but when I ate 3 servings of pork neck, the pork had more fat than the meat. It feels like eating 3 servings of fat. No matter how weird it may be...
The seafood miso was delicious. If you don't like fat, eat neck pork. Haehanjji is recommended..
Even though it is pork belly, the meat marbling is still alive!
I recommend soybean paste stew over kimchi stew!!
A meat restaurant in front of my house haha
The staff took care of it well and it was nice.
It's a bit expensive, but it's delicious.
It was 9,500 won per person, so I picked up 120 grams. Haha, my husband found out.
The soybean paste stew was delicious and the cold noodles were also good.
I'll go again next time haha
If you're going to grill meat, cook it properly.
Why don't you leave the tongs and scissors behind?
It was not that good because it was fried until it was almost burnt.

If you gave me some mushrooms, would you have grilled them?
Can you at least ask me or something?
We put it on the grill.
When I asked him to cut the mushrooms, he cut them roughly and sparingly...

The rule for soup is to cut mushrooms lengthwise...

And the meat itself didn't seem to be very tasty in the first place. Even considering that it was overcooked, it was dry without any juice, and the fat wasn't chewy at all.

The best Korean restaurant in Saha-gu!

A full table of fresh vegetables and various side dishes

Comes with fish, bossam, and cod stew or loach stew.

There is also a beef stew set meal, but the cod stew is the best!!!

If you order meat and an additional Korean meal for one person,
The number of side dishes has increased tremendously.

If two people go, 3 servings of meat plus 1 serving of Korean food are included.
Enjoy meat and side dishes to your heart’s content!!!

The vegetables are very fresh and the meat is much tastier than beef!!! ..

This is definitely pork belly!!!

The aunts are kind and the owner is chic, but the original owner changed after a long time!!!

The side dishes are a bit salty, but sometimes they're too salty, so there's hobolho!

Still, these days, it's rare to get this much for this price ㅡㅜ

The best cost-effective Korean restaurant in Busan
I come here sometimes to eat ssambap.
The beef ribs are okay...the loach stew is delicious.
There are a lot of side dishes and it feels like home cooking.
I mainly use the ssambap menu for lunch.
During the day, there are a lot of elderly guests like people attending gatherings.
It's good ~ It tastes good ^^ I like the food because it's clean and comes out quickly

Good value for money. The bean sprout soup is good, and the snack to go with a glass of soju in the evening is also delicious. Open 24 hours is also good.
There was a place where Jeonju bean sprout soup was delicious, but it is now gone. I wanted to introduce you to a foreign friend and take you with me, but no...

I was somewhat familiar with the way the food was served and the basic side dishes, so I asked my aunt and she said the same thing about the Blue House in Danggam-dong and the owner.
Taste that adults like
But I don't like duck in water.
Order Kogalbi
Tteokbokki tastes like Yangnyeong
I think grilling duck is the best.
Today, not boiled duck, but roasted duck.
I ordered it with seasoning rather than salt.
Three people came and thought one spice was too small, so we ordered one more. I roasted the garlic, sizzled the chives and bean sprouts, wrapped them in wraps, and ate the seasoned duck alone. It's delicious since it's been a while since I ate it. I was feeling weak due to a cold, but it was so delicious that it gave me strength. I liked grilled food better than porridge, but I think my husband was disappointed that he couldn't eat white boiled food. I'll have to come back next time to eat boiled rice.
This is a restaurant for seniors. The hall is hectic, so if you want to hold a meeting or have a quiet meal, you need to reserve a room in advance.
The soup is light and flavorful. Adults also like it because it seems to be made with just duck and medicinal herbs. The side dishes are also neat and clean. A house I often think of
I went with the elderly today, but since it was Saturday lunch time, there were a lot of people, so there was no one to guide me at the entrance, so I wandered around for a while.
After we were seated, the serving staff and the female owner responded very kindly, prepared the side dishes, and the main menu was delicious. I plan to visit again!

The spoiled meat from the meat restaurant here has a sour taste and tastes burnt even when it is not burned. It's a waste to give it even 1 star. Maybe it's because it's unlimited refills, but it doesn't taste good.
They only give you super cheap meat. Don't go here, go to the ripening store below.

The colors, the movement bring you right into the subject matter, often taken directly from the Bible.  I've included photographs of several of his works but honestly seeing it in person is much better.  Would highly recommend.  If you have a car, there is a small parking lot in the back of the museum.  Also note that the museum doesn't accept visitors between 1230-2 pm.  If you arrive during that time you can hang out in the garden cafe of the museum which is located in the grounds of the museum in an beautiful garden.  Would even recommend visiting the cafe before or after the museum visit.
The work of Mark Chagall was breathtaking!  The paintings were on a large scale and so colorful!  The series was of Exodus and centered on Bible stories.  Unfortunately, the Chagall Museum was only partially open during our visit. We missed the half with auditorium which I saw on a video later.
Following the route of the tour and reading the available material in the museum I felt I needed to know more information in the museum about Marc Chagall to really appreciate his impact on our modern world, perhaps the audio guide would have helped. I will admit, I am not particularly well read in art so I wonder if as a more casual art fan this might be a museum to miss unless you have a particular interest Marc Chagall.

This museum itself is set in a lovely garden and well laid out. The cafe looked great, although  I did not have time to stop. You will need to pass through metal detectors to enter the museum, this is after you buy your tickets. The staff were all very friendly. Note the museum was closed between 1pm and 2pm on the day I visited.
This museum will exceed your expectations and captivate you with its wealth, regardless of how much you appreciate Marc Chagall’s work. It is probably one of the best museums dedicated to an artist that I have ever visited. The fact that Chagall himself was involved in the creation of the museum makes it even more special. This is my second visit, and I still cannot get over the colors, the mystery, and the immense number of details that enrich his work.
Really interesting museum which honestly was so much more than we all expected. A very impressive Chagall collection and they actually also do a great job I'm telling the history of his life and ongoing politics for each decade as you walk through his work in time. A beautiful garden surrounds the museum and it has a nice cafe with great lunch opportunities. If you are lucky, as we were, there is even free parking behind the museum. A small parking lot dedicated the guests. You should go!

But the meat quality was good. it is delicious. Of course, they kindly provide side dishes and refills for soybean paste stew.
This is a restaurant I often go to.
First of all, it's cheap and the owner and staff are friendly.
There is no parking lot, but it is available at the back of the residential area.
The cabbage crust is so delicious.
Soybean paste soup continues to be refilled
I want to go again ^^
Good value for money
Soybean paste stew is delicious
It was so delicious that it was in the top 10 of the meat restaurants I went to for the first time since coming to Sejong, and the kimchi was so delicious haha.
I had the lunch special, crispy pork bulgogi.
it is delicious

Super good Sundubu! Broth itself is flavorful, with generous portions of Korean soft tofu. Goes so well with rice. This is a must try!
Side dishes are really good too and you can refill then.
Bibimbap is okay, not bad.
Being a chef for 9years,this is the 1st time that every mouth I eat blows my mind. It's just tofu but it's really very delicious. The seafood and tofu stew really hits the spot, warms the tummy, every mouth is very flavourful. Some comments Says that the imu is very rude, let me tell u from a chef's point of view. Imu is very friendly and polite. She just talk very fast resulting in those that doesn't understand korean will thinks that she is rude. She teaches me how to eat in a Korean way and recommends me what dish to go with. I told her that I love her food, she smiled from ear to ear. Really is a must try.
Jaedong is a Korean traditional restaurant specializing in fresh tofu dishes, and delivers an interesting culinary experience. However, be aware there is a requirement to order one meal per person, which may catch some off guard. Embrace the interesting variety of tofu-centric dishes and I would come back to try out different dishes.

Seafood Tofu Soup: 7.5/10
-Saltier and less spicy than other tofu soups I have tried.
-Tofu is not in blocks, it is more like a tofu scramble
The best Sundubu in the world! They use fresh beans to make tofu and their tofu is super difference than other places. Tofu here is not in shape but like cloudy. Customer service is also good even though they do not speak English here. The auntie smile for us all the time. The the price is reasonable. Best restaurant for my Korea Trip.

The side dishes that came with it were delicious as expected, but the white kimchi was really delicious and there were plenty of customers.
It's delicious too.

White kimchi is delicious.
The food is a bit sweet so it's suitable for a meal with children, but I wouldn't recommend it.
Recommended for adults, but parking is difficult.
There is a wait on weekend evenings, so I think you need to make a reservation in advance... The pork ribs are delicious and the side dishes are also worth eating.

One of the best place, I can recommend.
The loach stew with plenty of dried radish radish in it is attractive.
Especially with the salted fish oysters and Silbi kimchi served as side dishes.
The combination is so delicious.

As soon as you enter, you are greeted cheerfully.
As it is a single menu with my aunt, as soon as we sit down, we order according to the number of people.
It's so chic that the chin comes out and it's a shame.

I ate at two or three loach soup restaurants during my business trip to Namwon.
The combination with salted fish and oysters remains in my memory as the best leisure time.
It was very delicious 😄

The food at Askim Restaurant exceeded our expectations in every way. Each dish was a culinary masterpiece, bursting with flavor and expertly prepared using the finest ingredients. Whether it was the succulent kebabs, flavorful mezzes, or indulgent desserts, every bite left us wanting more.

What truly stood out, however, was the impeccable service we received throughout our meal. The staff at Askim Restaurant went above and beyond to ensure that we felt well taken care of, attending to our needs with attentiveness and professionalism. Their friendly demeanor and knowledge of the menu only added to the overall enjoyment of our dining experience.

As we left Askim Restaurant that evening, we couldn't help but reflect on what a wonderful time we had. The combination of excellent food, great service, and inviting atmosphere made it a dining experience we won't soon forget. I highly recommend Askim Restaurant to anyone looking for a taste of authentic Turkish cuisine and a memorable dining experience in Dubai.
Review Feedback:

The food at this restaurant was excellent, particularly the cold mezzeh. The Warak Enab and Hummus were outstanding, and I loved the Eggplant Fattouch. The Potato Harra was incredibly tasty, and the Makanek was delightful. The main course was also delicious. The pastry selection was great, and the Pistachio Milk Cake was absolutely amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed the coffee with Turkish delight; it was a nice touch. I recommend trying the white coffee after such a delightful meal.
We came here for lunch, the place was calm and quite, as well as the waiters were so cooperative and quickly ready receiving our order, the food was delicious especially the Tatre Barak and baba Ghanouj as well as Yalanje, Arayes Meat. The restaurant has very comfortable and well prepared
I had a wonderful dining experience! The food was incredibly tasty with generous portions, and the service was outstanding. A special thank you to Mahran, who not only made our visit enjoyable with his constant smile and great attitude, but was also very helpful in guiding us on what to choose from the menu. Joseph, who also served us, was equally amazing—friendly, always smiling, and made us feel so welcome. Even more impressive, all the staff were working from their hearts and were truly amazing. Highly recommend!

Isn’t there a reason why there are no people at lunchtime?

First of all, only noodles are enough for one person. It's an octopus house, but that's okay.

I ordered 10,000 won noodles, but I don't know what the flavor is. The only meat is boiled chicken breast. Is this chicken soup? Is it a feast day? But first of all, it has no taste. If it tastes better than what I cook at home for a late-night snack, I'll tell you everything. I don't know what kind of noodles they are, but this is my first time eating yellow and crumbly noodles. I thought they were corn noodles, but they were so crumbly? I want to
The noodles served at Lamb Skewers Restaurant are more delicious~
I fill my stomach with side dishes, egg rolls and kimchi, and leave some noodles.
The biggest and plumpest octopus and octopus in the world
The octopus here is better than the octopus at other octopus restaurants.
However, eating alone is only allowed with octopus!
The seasoning is good~~
The spicy flavor is a bit spicy and the normal flavor is a bit weak.
It's a bit disappointing that it doesn't have that in-between flavor.
It's a spicy taste that feels good even though it's spicy~~
For reference...
The female boss is very!!
Be blunt
lol
Please note~~
A typically hairless and unfriendly house.
As soon as you sit down, the sticky table suggests an ominous energy...
From the side dish setting, he brought the tray with a thud and almost threw it with a thud. I don't know what it was, but he suddenly clattered away and walked away, but the cutlery container under the table was staring at me. I'm busy, so I guess that's what he meant by putting the cutlery on your own.
When I asked how to order it according to the number of people, he said yes, just order that, but did he even listen to the question...?
Sure enough, the menu I ordered was as quick as a crab... I couldn't even finish the bottle of soju I ordered.
To be honest, I wanted to rush out and move to another store right away, but since it was Friday, all the nearby stores were already full, and on top of all that, business hours were shortened due to the coronavirus, so it was difficult to go back in. I held on to the mental energy that had already rushed out the door and forced myself to sit in my seat...
Huh... This store is clearly a zero-pay merchant until the last checkout. Even though it is marked on the dedicated application as a zero-pay affiliated store, it does not accept zero-pay. There is no need to check because I already confirmed it, but out of courtesy, I asked if zero-pay was possible, but he got disgusted and said that's what we do. They said I couldn't do it and I wasn't registered, but the Z-MAP app even says that recently issued prepaid gift certificates can be used... but I want to believe that the app is strange.

Raw raw fish is delicious. There is a bit of sea squirt and sea cucumber in the raw fish.

It's a good idea to serve the noodles in small portions.

However, when I took my mom with me, I ordered and ate lily porridge, but it wasn't lily porridge, it was vegetable porridge.

Yeonpotang was cool and nice! It’s a great place for people in their 40s and older! The side dishes were clean and varied.

It's a pity that there are many things lacking, such as hygiene, toilet management, and service. It looks like it's been in operation for a long time, but it looks like it needs some repairs.

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Ba Da restaurant, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The food was simply outstanding—each dish was crafted with fresh, high-quality ingredients, bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. Whether you’re a foodie or just enjoy a good meal, this place will not disappoint.

The ambience was equally impressive. The décor and lighting created a warm, cozy atmosphere that was perfect for a relaxed and enjoyable dining experience. Whether you’re celebrating a special occasion or just having a casual meal, the setting is ideal.

What truly sets this restaurant apart is the impeccable customer service. From the moment I made the reservation, the staff were helpful and professional, making sure every detail was perfect. Throughout the evening, the servers were attentive without being intrusive, and their genuine friendliness added a personal touch that made the experience even more memorable. Even the process of getting the bill was smooth and efficient, rounding off a flawless evening.

I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great food, a wonderful atmosphere, and top-tier service.
The real thing is here.!!!
At BADA, which has been remodeled as a Japanese restaurant, you'll find a wonderful and amazing taste. I've been to many fancy Japanese restaurants in Dubai, but I've never seen one of them so delicious and high quality.
First, you'll have a luxurious oriental atmosphere the moment you enter this restaurant.
Second, everything tastes great, from the first salad and appetizers (tuna tartare, fried chicken wings, etc.) to the main sushi and nigiri set dishes without a single failure.
In particular, the freshness of the fresh tuna, eels(unagi), and wagyu, which were directly shipped from Japan, offers amazing flavors that you've never experienced anywhere else.
Also, kebir and truffle, which are generously added to various dishes, are standard. After eating cold sushi and nigiri, try warm Japanese ramen. Choosing mochi ice cream for dessert is a must.
If you want to experience real Japanese food, I would say that BADA is the best restaurant in Dubai.
Bada restaurant is serving authentic Japanese food. They have literally the best sushi in town. And the Wagyu Sando was melting by the first bite. All ingredients are so fresh and even Sake and draft beer is refreshing. If you couldn't find any proper Sushi places in dubai(just like me... who's from that part of the world), Bada is the best option to have the real Sushi. About Parking, you can park your car in the parking lot of the Novotel Suite without any issues.

You can buy raw fish separately at Garak Market and then go up to the seafood restaurant and order food separately, but we went straight to the raw fish center at the recommendation of an acquaintance.
I heard that you can eat cockle shabu-shabu in the spring. When we went there, the season was just over so we couldn't have shabu-shabu, but we did eat spring flounder raw fish. There was a lot of food served, so the four of us ate our fill. A special feature of Garak Market is the large parking space, which is great. Everyone who went with us said that the food was delicious and that it was nice to be able to hang out comfortably.
Since I have never been there, I decided to go and experience it on this trip.

The food was clean and delicious. I had cold raw fish soup and sashimi set meal
It was nice to have fresh raw fish and beautiful beach is near here
Although it is located in a quiet place, the raw fish is very delicious.
Worst. It looks like raw fish, not live fish.
Spicy stew that doesn’t even meet the standards.
If you're curious, go check it out.
It is divided into the first and second floors. The first floor sells raw fish, and the second floor is a very spacious space where you can eat. You can taste a variety of foods such as raw fish, clams, and lobster. The ingredients are fresh and the taste is very good. The owner is also generous. Please give us a lot of service and do business so that we have no choice but to visit often. I really like it^^

It's a typical restaurant that feels a bit old, but the taste and view are the best... I recommend the spicy fish stew 35,000 won course per person... The sukidashi is good.
I'm a person who really likes raw fish...
After renal transplant surgery, I couldn't eat raw food, so I used to pass it by, but for the first time in a while, I only ate cooked food at a raw fish restaurant. They were friendly and the food was prepared well, so I had a good time eating with my friends. I will use it occasionally.
I had a good meal because this restaurant is located in a place where you can see the Geumgang Estuary.
The food comes out and goes in quickly, but I'm not sure if it's fresh overall. It's 50,000 won per person, but it feels a bit flat compared to what it looks like.

First of all, the owner is friendly, the store is clean, and the food is plentiful. I ordered sweet and sour pork, the meat was seasoned and salty and the sauce was good. The jajangmyeon was good as it wasn't too sweet, the meat in the jjamppong seemed to be cut to the right size, and the soup had a very spicy taste.
Seafood jjamppong includes 2 small crabs and 2 large shrimp. I can't see red meat or squid very well. So, I was a little disappointed that there wasn't much seafood compared to the name of the menu. As the menu name suggests, Shrimp Jjamppong has a lot of small shrimp.
Jjamppong is not too spicy, not very spicy, and has a lot of onions and a lot of fiery taste. The price is 10,500 won... It feels a little expensive....
Wow, there are no pictures of me eating jjamppong...
It's the best Jjamppong I've had recently.
Tangsyuk is also very good.
The soup is perfect for me. It’s refreshing, not salty, and the taste is Jjambbong~~
I had Chinese cold noodles and it was refreshing and good.
It was a clean place and I had a delicious meal.

My husband loves coming here for his smoothies, and I recently discovered we have a corporate discount we’ve never used—so that helps with the cost, which I did find pretty high.

The place has a nice, organic vibe that fits their brand. However, as a coffee lover, I have to say the coffee is weak and lacks of flavour. The portions are generous but it doesn’t give me the caffeine kick.

Ps. Gate Mall parking is horrible. We stuck in the traffic on the way out so long that we had to pay extra for the parking fees
I really enjoyed my meal here. What a charming restaurant, with lots of knooks and crannies to hide away in. There's lots of private spaces, and plants everywhere. If you fancy a healthy salad and fresh juice, this is definitely the place. All food is vegan. Also, they don't use any plastic.
I ordered small tea for Q$20, it tasted so good. Vibe here is fantastic.  I also can charge my mobile phone here, it’s so convenient.
It is a vegan place, only soy milk/ oat milk for lattes or flatwhite. Thus is is not my favourite place for coffee. When im here i get their smoothies, forest smoothies or anti inflammatory smoothies (45qar). Sometimes their acai bowl but at 60 qar. Sigh. Too expensive sometimes. They also sells kombucha, matcha 🍵 tea boxes, some organic herbs, Cold pressed juices, and vegan butter. The atmosphere is nice, a jungle feel.
Evergreen Organica is the perfect spot if you’re looking for calm, very good service and good! I really recommend it! Thank you to the staff for being very welcoming!

As soon as you enter the entrance, you are immediately struck by the heat. In a large space, there is one wall air conditioner, a small stand air conditioner, and several fans working hard, but they don't seem to be able to block the heat coming in through the open windows and doors. I think it would be more efficient to close the window.
Some customers just sit and wait for their order to be processed and then leave.
Seafood kill noodles cost 7,000 won per person, but if you visit alone, you have to pay 8,000 won, adding 1,000 won.
I've traveled alone and used many restaurants, but this is the first time I've ever been charged extra for visiting alone.
The seafood kalguksu consists of one shrimp, half a crab, three mussels, and about 10 clams.
There weren't too many clams in the 7,000 won seafood noodle soup.
As you put the kalguksu in your mouth, the taste of flour spreads in your mouth. It was a late lunch after walking for two hours, so I had a good meal.
It is really not recommended to visit in hot weather.
The taste of kalguksu is very similar to that of Nongshim Kalguksu Ramen. The same goes for noodles. The seafood and green onion pancakes are grilled crispy. It's okay to eat. I don't think I'll be visiting again.
I ate something delicious.
I went to this house after going for a walk in Dadaepo during the Lunar New Year holiday... I was hurt by the unkindness of the staff... I felt uncomfortable with the dirty table... The kalguksu I received after waiting for a long time tasted like wheat and the noodles were slippery... The clams and mussels were more hollow than the kernels. There are more shellsㅠ It's not a cool clam soup... It tastes like a bland soupㅠㅜ

Greeted warmly by the husband and wife team, both Korean, their genuine friendliness instantly made us feel at home.

We indulged in a selection of dishes, opting for classics like 삼겹살 (samgyeopsal) and 양념 갈비 (yangnyeom galbi). While the flavors hinted at authenticity, I couldn't help but notice that both meats were slightly dry, lacking the succulence I had hoped for. A tad more finesse on the grill could elevate these dishes to their full potential.

The 군만두 (gunmandu), though decent, didn't quite steal the spotlight. It served as a satisfactory side, but nothing extraordinary. However, amidst the mix, the 해물 순두부 (haemul sundubu) emerged as a shining star. Its rich flavors and comforting warmth made it a standout among the offerings, a dish I'd eagerly return for.

Service was commendable, with attentive servers ensuring our needs were met swiftly and with a smile. Despite the minor setbacks, the delightful haemul sundubu and the inviting atmosphere crafted by the owners' hospitality make this place a definite recommendation. It's a spot where the warmth of the hosts and the promise of culinary delights combine for a memorable dining experience.
Its quite good despite some bad reviews that said they had bad services. Food was ok, especially japchae. But samgyeopsal quite dry, it would be nice if its a little fatty. They also offered many banchans and fresh veggies, you can refill it as much as you want. The kimchi is good ! And thanks for the compliment, the steam egg. Much appreciated it.
I can only say it's ""Korean Food"". Taste is good, but nothing too special. Portion is more than enough, but priced quite high. I can say the Jjajangmyeon has really nice noodles though.
It's located on the boulevard Gading Serpong which is main road and visible from the street.

Service from some staffs are lack, but I found one waitress that are kind and full of smile, but forgot to ask her name, everytime she served, clean the table, I said thank you and she replied, while the first staff quite unfriendly.

For the food itself I like it. I tried their Ganjajang (Jajang myeon - noodle with blackbean & onion & meat stirfry), I tried the dwaeji galbi & pork belly.

For the banchan / side dish, they are good. No overpowering vinegar / chilly powder on kimchi.
It was very disappointing. Their charcoal was not ready, so we grill the meat by using portable stove, and the taste was really disappointing. Side dish was ok, taste of yokgaejang also good. Only that portable stove that makes me disappointed

Someone might say that you should put kimchi soup in gomtang, but that's just a preference. It's already made with basic seasoning, so it can be salty if you eat it like that
This seems to be a popular restaurant.  There was a line of people waiting to get in during lunch time on a Tuesday. We went at around 2:30 PM to avoid the crowds. Restaurant was 70 to 80% full even then.  The place seems well run. The 곰탕(beef soup with rice) is excellent. The 반찬 (side dishes) consisted of 김치, 깍두기, 풋고추, 마늘 and some sauces. Service was also good. Very good restaurant overall.
Boiled rice with beef (i think it calls “Kom Tang”). Warming you especially in winter season. Local restaurant where you can’t miss.
a restaurant more than 100 years old. Yummy !!

The freshness of the raw fish was good. The side dish sukidashi is also delicious and made with care. The clam stew (?), which is not overly salty, is delicious, and is especially fragrant, is excellent.
Overall very good.

The owner?! Please explain what each menu item is.
You were very kind!! It's a weekday and there are a few tables.
It was moderately busy, but they did a great job.
I ate a lot of very fresh seafood for the price of 120,000 won!
Everything was delicious and the two of us ate to our fill...
Maeuntang is also a slightly clear spicy stew?! It was
Belvedere Resort pick-up and sending service (comfortable drinking available)
Although the portion was not large, it was nice to be able to taste a variety of fresh, seasonal seafood for only 50,000 won per person (Hongdo Special for 4 people).
(Geoje specialty elephant clams, sotdae conch, barley shrimp sashimi, etc.)
When I went there, the focus was on red sea bream and sea bass sashimi, but sometimes they also offer peantjji (small sea bream).
Everything was good, from the beginning of chive pancakes to the refreshing spicy spicy stew at the end.
I liked that the staff were friendly and cool.
Made with my own money
Don’t go to any of the strange raw fish restaurants around, come here!! No, sukidashi is no joke, the raw fish is all delicious, and there’s a karaoke room next door, and even pick-up!! All 3 beats are correct. Don't bother going somewhere else, just come here. The aunts are all friendly and the food is delicious haha.

Excellent Chinese Restaurant.
This is a delicious local Chinese restaurant. In general, all dishes are pretty good. Please note that if you order a course or meal, you can reserve a room. There is a banquet hall on the 3rd floor, and the restaurant also has its own parking lot, which is convenient. It disappeared and changed to a Chinese restaurant under a different name in October 23.
There are no customers and they are going to close. I got diarrhea 4 times after eating sweet and sour pork, perhaps because it was an old food ingredient.
The jjambbong smells bad because they used spicy oil. Since I ate more than 100,000 won, I asked for a little jjamppong soup as a service, but they said they would never give it to me. Not because the food is delicious, not because the food is cheap,
It doesn't taste good and is twice as expensive as other places, but the service is twice as good? This is it. Sweet and sour pork costs 33,000 won, but this is a restaurant that gives you just like beef and it's tasteless and doesn't even give you anything like jjamppong soup. So I ordered jjamppong, but it wasn't tasty. If it was delicious, I wouldn’t even leave a comment like this.
In the end, as I continued to say something, they gave me an old frozen soup service. They even poured the sauce on their own without even asking me to dip it, and there wasn't even a single vegetable in the sauce. There are 4 pieces of pineapple. How much are you trying to save on cost and how much are you trying to save? I'm really curious as to why places like this still exist?

It's possible. There are many friendly places and delicious places. Go somewhere else.
We had lunch here at the beginning of March. We arrived and there was a free table, so we didn't have to wait. I like this place because they have 20 different kinds of palanquins and they're delicious. They're not expensive. If you pass this way again, We definitely won't miss it.
The food is neat and really delicious, and the set meal costs 16,000 won per person, but it's not worth the money.

Category 1 (under 60000 KRW, 50 USD)

The restaurant specializes in Shellfish Soup called Jaechoepguk.
Jaechoep, the small shellfish grow in clean freshwater and are known to be good for improving liver function, dieting, recovering from fatigue, and preventing vascular diseases or anemia.

There is course menu priced at 60000 KRW including appetizer, main dishes and dessert. So it is very good value for the money.
The appetizer starts from amuse bouche with various vegetables, small portion raw fish or seafood wrapped with lettuce or perilla leaf.
Combinated Sashmi platter comes as a Main dish, and then various Sushi come after.
It is in deed very generous amount and makes me full.
Staffs are kind and there are large validated parking lot.
This place is my favorite place and used to go very often. It’s very rare restaurant serving fresh marsh clam food. It’s good place with your parents.
Try this clam soup. This soup is famous in Busan and when I just drop by to soothe my heavily drunken stomach last night, nothing much expected but the price is 12,000 won for bf. Pricy! we thought. But when food served, we are much impressed.
It served with BiBimBap and  well grilled makerel fish and many impressive and tasty side dishes.
All are so tasty and soup is also nice.
Worth while to try especially if you are staying in GangNam area.
Maybe next time, I will try dinner with Soju or SoMaek.
Be sure to come with friends, and ideally someone who can speak Korean. If you're by yourself they'll only sell you the basic clam soup meal, but it's incredibly good and an excellent value.
Provides more homemade-like seafood dishes compared to other famous Korean seafood cuisines such as raw dishes(sashimi) or spicy seafood stew.

It's the worst!!!!!
The food was good and the atmosphere was nice, but the lady working there made me feel very upset. The person wearing a gold necklace and round pattern earrings seems to have the attitude of speaking informally at any time. To customers and part-time workers!!!
While I was eating, he said he was cleaning it up and threw it loudly as if the dishes would break. When I ordered chicken porridge, he said it was the last order and made me feel bad. So how many? This was my first time at a store that spoke like this.
There's so much more to it than this that I don't know what to say.
Not only is this store not the only one, I will never go there again and I am going to tell everyone around me not to go there either.
Perhaps because of a water play accident, the entire valley was destroyed, so I have no intention of going there again.
There were times when the food I ordered came out too late, and even though it was a place to play in the water, there were no proper changing rooms, and parking wasn't enough. The food tasted good everywhere. Anyway, I won't go there again.
The taste of grilled chicken, stir-fried soup, boiled rice, and side dishes is excellent.
The stream is really nice, but the employees swear at me and don't want to work, so I'm scared and can't even order an extra bottle of cider.
The taste was good and the water was good. It was a shame there was no tube or anything.

Local people are loving sashimi with water.
If you looks strange this dishes. Don't worry. Just one bites. You will fall in love.
I was recommended this place by my Airbnb host. The 물회 here is served differently from other places as it is served dry. You can then add rice, noodles, gochujang (home-made) and/or ice and water to make bibim mulhoe, the standard mulhoe, or bimbimbap mulhoe. Tables come with instructions on how to enjoy it in the three different ways, but they're in Korean. However, if you ask for the servers to explain it to you, they seemed happy to do so (observed some guests asking for advice!). Price is a little on the steeper end, but it's raw fish at a popular restaurant so it's to be expected; even then, it's not overly expensive, and definitely worth a try.
Though we didn't read Korean, the staff looked after us, and the food was delicious. Traditional Korean style sitting on the floor.

Best intestine in Busan
This hormone specialty store was ridiculously delicious.

This popular local restaurant is always fully booked even on weekdays, so reservations are required.

I thought the bright red offal would be spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all and had no odor. Mino is delicious, but Marucho is even more delicious.

The lettuce mixed with kimchi that goes with the horumon is so delicious that I think I had to refill it at least 5 times.

Before we finished, we had the hormone hotpot, which was so delicious that I think it's a good idea to come here for that purpose.I also added some rice to it and ate it, and it was heavenly.

I gained 4kg just today, so next time I'd like to eat less hormones and focus on soup and rice.
The No. 1 lamb tripe restaurant in Korea. This is a place I definitely go to when I go to Busan. The seasoning looks strong, but it isn't at all.

I can't stand having my own parking lot in this crowded neighborhood.
Friendly and typical Busan-style lamb tripe
Busan is a city famous for lamb tripe. In particular, it can be said that the seasoning and dipping sauce are unique in that they are made with garlic as a base. Of course, I don't know if it's correct to say that this is Busan style, but it is a seasoning that is difficult to find in other regions.
Jinju lamb tripe also has the standard taste of garlic-based Busan-style lamb tripe. Since the sauce is garlic-based, it is safe to say that there is no unpleasant smell from the intestines, and the chewy texture of the lamb is excellent due to the fresh intestines and well-seasoned meat.
However, when I enter the store, the smell that comes to mind seems like it needs some maintenance, and the unremarkable interior is also a deductible factor.
Wherever you go, grilling beef intestines is a must, and here too, they grilled the beef intestines properly without leaving my seat, so I was able to enjoy the food comfortably.
I think this is a restaurant worth visiting at least once for those who come to Busan from other regions and those who like lamb tripe.
I went to this place often, but it didn't taste the same as before!
Have my tastes changed? There is a parking lot, but the entrance is difficult to get into.
It's delicious. Even if you're busy, it would be better if you cook it slowly.

It was convenient because there was a parking lot, and the parking information staff kindly guided parking. The food was delicious, and although it may vary depending on the person in charge of the table, our person in charge had to ask us to prepare the basic foods included in the menu we ordered before they were provided. It seemed like they didn't know whether it was included in the menu structure or not.
In other words, we found out when we got home that there was a menu item that we forgot to provide. I think it's Kebake and I hope others will meet good people and receive proper service.
As a family of 8, we ate well and enjoyed the drinks served. They provide plenty of bread according to the number of people. The parking lot was small, so it was a bit annoying to have to get directions for parking in the underground shopping mall, but I was satisfied with the restaurant service. If you think about 40,000 won per person, you can eat plenty. This is a discounted price.

I think I visit once a month.

I usually visit Centum Shinsegae often.
Deokcheon branch facilities and service were very good.
Personally, I am more satisfied than the new branch.
If I have the chance, I would like to visit the Deokcheon branch again.

I think the taste is the best anywhere in Outback.
The special thing is that the existing button mushroom soup is still there,
There was no corn soup in sight.
Instead, there was cheese soup, but I personally think button mushroom soup was the best.

This time, we even used a coupon for the chicken tender salad, so it was too much for two people to eat.
I can't comment on the food, but please refer to the photos.

Lastly, the disappointing thing is that there is not a lot of parking space, but it is inconvenient because it is on a hill.
There is also a Starbucks on the first floor and it is almost full.
Fortunately, there is a manager who cooperates, so there are no major difficulties.
Other than the fact that it was a little noisy and I couldn't hear the server, it was okay overall. The food is perfect.

There is another shop on the first floor. Go up the stairs on the side to the second floor and enter the store.

I ordered the sashimi platter.
When I heard that it was 60,000KRW, I had a high impression at first, but it provides enough food for 2-3 people.
Rather than just a platter of sashimi, the idea is to have a whole fish cooked and served.

① Appetizers (lettuce, perilla, garlic, salad, porridge, sushi rice, abalone sashimi, etc.)
②Sashimi (white fish.A lot on a plate about 30cm in diameter)
③ Hot pot + rice (seafood hotpot)

Lettuce, perilla, and garlic could be added free of charge. Maybe you can add rice as well.

I was able to enjoy the same fish in many different ways and was very satisfied. It seems that they also offer seafood bowls, but if you are going with more than 2 or 3 people, I think it would be better to order fish.
The atmosphere is nice and the sashimi is fresh.
The spicy fish stew is neat. It would be good for a family gathering. The parking lot is a bit far away.
It seems to have a little less old taste.

I spent about half an hour looking for the glass palace until I realized that it did not exist and that the picture was not real. It is funny, but overall I had a good time there.
Visited the former site of The Crystal Palace of London today. So sad that it got destroyed in that fire. Built in Hyde Park, London, to house the Great Exhibition of 1851. Three times the size of St Paul's Cathedral. There were talks of rebuilding it in 2013. Very sad.

Hopefully will be rebuilt at some point soon. You can see the original grand steps and a few of the statues (despite some being destroyed). The sphinxes were repainted to the original colour in 2016 and look awesome!
A quaint English park is definitely cliche, but also the perfect way to spend an afternoon. London's city parks are filled with rolling hills and small ponds and those quiet nooks to truly escape.
Nice Park, but some areas need to be cleared flattened and the rubble removed and either regrassed or tarmac and maybe some picnic tables.
Visited frequently and many occasions before Reggae concerts, Track and field events, Basketball 🏀 Festival, Crystal Palace Academy development centre, Netball, Swimming 🏊‍♀️ and also working on the maintenance Crystal Palace Station 🚉. Atletic meetings

I don't know because I haven't been to Seomyeon, but it wasn't as smoky as Jagalchi here. I don't know if it's because there aren't many customers, but the ventilation seems to be good. There is nothing special about the taste of tripe. No matter where you eat it, it is difficult to not taste it. They cooked it diligently and inspected it carefully, so there was no inconvenience at all when eating it. After the meal, I gave them some ground kale juice and it was delicious.
It was Sunday evening and there was not a single table of customers.
I don't want to go to a store that is soliciting customers outside, but it's cold and I'm just lazy, so I go in.
Originally, I didn’t like the tripe restaurant in Suyeong.
Because it's not direct fire...
My aunt cooked everything for me, but it wasn't convenient and it was somewhat inconvenient.
I didn't really like the sauce for the tripe, so I only ate 3 servings.
I like Yang Daechang, so two people usually eat 5 to 7 servings.
I didn't want to eat any more
The aunts were friendly, but I don't want to go again.
The seasoning for pickled vegetables was delicious.
They say there were a lot of customers on Saturday, but maybe because of the coronavirus, it was very quiet on Sunday.
Both the owner and the lady are friendly and both the lamb and tripe are delicious and delicious.
It's a good idea. I went to Naver because there were a lot of them....
In particular, never order fried rice. Tasteless fried rice for 10,000 won
At first, the guide was friendly, so I went in instead of my regular restaurant. I had to order 3 servings, which is a lot to eat with my young daughter, and there was a lot left, but I turned off the light and the greasiness doubled. I talked to the owner who paid the bill when I left, but there was no response. I don't eat food according to my age - did I look young? - I felt a little offended and left after paying 66,000 won for the assorted dish - shouldn't the service always be the same??? I won't go again

This is a restaurant where you can have your own course meal at an affordable price. Course starts from 30,000 won.

I searched through Naver, but for the C course, you have to order for 4 people to get the Naver search level. The 2-person C course omits the number of eggplants and doesn't add raw fish, but they give more. It seems to be at an average level among the many raw fish centers in Millak-dong.

It is one of the most famous places in Busan to try this traditional dish, and the Haeundae head store is popular with both locals and tourists.

Here are some things to know before going:

The restaurant is famous for its bokguk, a soup made from pufferfish, known for being a delicacy in Korea. The dish is considered safe to eat as it is prepared by skilled chefs, but pufferfish can be dangerous if not handled properly, which is why dining at a reputable place like Geumsubokguk is recommended.

Besides bokguk, the restaurant offers a variety of other dishes made from pufferfish, including fried pufferfish, pufferfish sashimi, fried pufferfish and spicy stews.

The restaurant is often busy, especially during lunch and dinner hours, so you may want to arrive early or be prepared for a wait.

Prices may be higher than at standard restaurants due to the specialty of the ingredients, but the quality and experience are usually considered worth it.

The atmosphere is traditional and welcoming, providing a good opportunity to experience authentic Korean dining in Busan.

It’s located near Haeundae Beach, so it’s a convenient stop if you’re visiting the area. The restaurant is well-known, so it should be easy to find with local directions or maps.

While some staff may speak limited English, the menu usually includes photos, and it may have some English translations, making it easier for non-Korean speakers to order.

If you're planning to try pufferfish for the first time, Geumsubokguk is a highly recommended and safe option!
First time having puffer fish.  The restaurant sources farm raised fugu, so no worries about the toxin.  The fish had a very firm texture and very mild flavor.  The soup was good, but the fried fugu nuggets were the best.
Decided to go here becauss of the specialty. Shop was very crowded with a lot of line, good sign. We enjoyed the fried one better than the soup. This is that place where you just go and try once
Golden puffer was fabulous! What a lovely surprise on my 1st visit. Staff was so kind and attentive!  :))))) Thank you for a delicious meal and delightful experience! 😋
The first time eating puffer fish, the puffer soup taste so great, sashimi and tempura are worth as well.
If you were looking for special food in Busan, here we go mate.

Very tasty. Needed help with what to order and how to eat it. They are known for their octopus, shrimp, and tripe. We substituted pork belly for tripe and it was delicious. We added much of the spices after and it wasn't too spicy. Very good combination of flavors. Definitely lived up to the hype. A must visit for seafood lovers.
The food was good, but we didn't get to choose spiciness when we ordered.

The food tastes okay. Braised cutlassfish. Boiled fish Sojja costs 30,000 won. It's hard to give this place 5 stars because there are many cheap and delicious places in Gimje. The kimchi was sour, even the sweet potato shoots. I understand because the weather is hot, but...

I visited without expectations due to the continued failure of loach stew these days. The fried food was delicious and many people said the egg rolls were great, so I ate it with loach stew. The loach stew was thick and rich (I don’t usually prefer thick loach stew), so I enjoyed it. The fries were nice and crispy, and the egg rolls were really egg rolls. I really enjoyed the green onion kimchi.

good taste,  spicy
C I stopped by for a quick meal while passing by alone. It has a typical old-fashioned atmosphere in a market, and the food is very delicious. Friendly, but the bathroom is a bit uncomfortable. Just think of it as a long-established store in the market and visit it.
One of the main recommended foods in Yeongdeok is raw flounder, and Cheongsong Restaurant is one of the oldest restaurants. I came here again after visiting 3 years ago, and it was a bit better with a young person taking the order and serving me. Previously, it took a long time for an elderly person to take orders and serve food. If you mix the flounder with an appropriate amount of seasoning sauce without adding water, it becomes savory and savory.
I've tried Mulgomtang before and this time I tried monkfish soup, and it's just as good as Mulgomtang. Jiri made by boiling raw monkfish is refreshing and light at the same time. As for the side dishes, it was a shame that the refreshing stone pakjikji of the past was gone, but neat and tasty side dishes such as flounder sikhye are still provided. I hadn't felt it before, but it has a slightly salty taste.
I hope that you will continue to be in business for a long time so that you can visit from time to time and enjoy the delicious memories. The location is inside the market and the sign is small, so it's not easy to find.
I still can't pay by card. They say they only accept cash. You may be surprised because not many people carry cash these days.
If you were to introduce restaurants known for their moray eel soup while traveling along National Route 7 on the Yeongdeok-Uljin-Samcheok course, in the northern region there would be Samcheok Sea Restaurant, Uljin Dolseom Restaurant, and Yeongdeok's Cheongsong Restaurant.

Moray fish soup, a winter delicacy, is called by many names depending on the region, such as Mulgomtang, Mulmegitang, and Multeombeongi. Those who are trying moray eel soup for the first time may say that they do not like the mushy texture, but once you fall in love with the taste, the more chilly the weather, the more you remember it.

Cheongsong Restaurant, which retains the appearance of a restaurant in a rural market, is a well-known Yeongdeok restaurant. Let me introduce some side dishes that stand out: flounder sikhye and ajijeotgal. Flounder sikhye, which can only be tasted in northern Gyeongbuk and Gangwon-do, is a rice thief as it is well known.

You might be a bit surprised that the price of moray eel soup is 15,000 won, but it is a generous portion for one person. Depending on the region and restaurant, there are places where it is served as spicy stew with aged kimchi rather than as a spicy stew, but Cheongsong Restaurant serves it as a spicy stew with aged kimchi.

Moray fish soup with a cool and soft (some might say mushy) texture, whether it's clear soup or spicy spicy soup, is a winter delicacy that comes to mind when the weather is chilly.

The steamed seasoning is thick, so mix it with rice and eat it with sari.
It's perfect~ The side dishes were clean and delicious.
This is the place I go to whenever I crave steamed monkfish for several years.
You can park for about 3 cars in front of the store.
It was good monkfish stew. Sojja was 30,000 won and it was good for two adults. It's not very filling, but I think it would have been more filling if the portion was a little larger.
This is a medium packaging for steamed monkfish. It's not salty and the taste is good. It also contains a lot of monkfish. It is usually served spicy, but you can ask for it to be non-spicy before ordering. Parking can accommodate about 3 cars.
There are more monkfish than bean sprouts.
He is kind and generous.
Needless to say, highly recommended

When I went to other places, it seemed like there weren't enough bones for the Gamjatang Soju for 2 people, so even though it was my first time here, I tried to eat a lot, but there was a lot of food, but the bones didn't spread well as if they were undercooked, and the mustard sauce was very bland, so it was okay to eat it with kimchi. The kimchi was delicious. The fried rice is just mediocre
Since it is a chain store, there is nothing special about it. It's clean and the service is good. Because it is on the second floor, it is less crowded than other stores. The only drawback is that there are no seats.

I visit my hometown every time I visit. Even children enjoy eating each and every meal so deliciously and happily. The final bossam, duck meat, and gondre rice give you the pleasure of starting with Western food and ending with Korean food.
I had course B meal. The Korean restaurant is delicious.
I heard there was a place like this in Oncheonjang. I studied cooking in France and it is a fusion Korean cuisine. It is very clean and the ingredients are very tasty. There is nothing missing. It is good to take guests.
I didn't have high expectations because there were many reviews saying it wasn't good value for money, so I wasn't particularly dissatisfied with it.

Pros: (French food) was pretty good. The visuals were good, the abalone was soft, and they had the sense to even pre-warm some dishes before serving them.

Disadvantage: (Korean food) had to be shared among several people, with one colander per table as shown in the photo, so the portions were clearly lacking. If the amount of boiled pork or smoked duck is not enough, you can add it by paying an additional 15,000 won.

The Korean side dish tasted a bit bitter at the end... but it felt more healthy(?) than sweet. The water kimchi tastes like it was mixed with additional plain water, and the soybean paste soup was all radish, so it was bland.

Others: I don't know if it's an advantage or a disadvantage... but for a course meal, the cooking time is a bit quick. Not suitable for people who want to enjoy French cuisine slowly while chatting. This is great for people who want to continue eating without stopping in the middle.

The side dishes were also neat... It was the first time in a long time that I had a delicious meal. Please note that they are relocating nearby soon.
I ate a lot of food
It's less spicy but slightly spicy. I had 2 bowls of rice and added some sari.
It was delicious. I enjoyed it very much.
The best monkfish stew restaurant in this neighborhood (I think).
It is significant that it is located inside a one-story building, so parking space is limited.
The price is expensive, but the quality is better than cheaper places. But I think it's a lot more expensive than that...
There are a lot of people and a good number of employees.
When you order, cabbage salad is served first, allowing you to spend time waiting for it to be cooked.
The dish came with side dishes, but the side dishes were pre-made so they weren't warm (especially the pancakes). However, because the quality is relatively expensive, there are some that are surprisingly good, and many of them are lightly seasoned, so they go well with dishes.
The steamed dish comes with peanuts sprinkled on top, but you can't really feel it when eating it.
I think the quantity is a lot, but considering the price...
What I ordered was the steamed seafood monkfish (3 servings), and the contents (I don't know if there may be more) are 2 octopuses, 2 crabs, 1 crab, 1 shrimp, and monkfish.
I'm a person who doesn't like spicy food, so when I ordered it, I asked for it to be not spicy, and they made it really not spicy. (words that are good)
So overall, it was okay because it was less irritating.

Tips when eating - When an order comes, you can eat a lot if you focus on braised monkfish rather than trying other side dishes.

Cons: There are a lot of people. Among them, there is someone with a loud voice. In other words, it is noisy.
I am satisfied with the quantity and taste.  Enjoy the hot spring breeze. After eating. Find a nearby cafe and have a cup of coffee. A one-day family outing course is available.
Even if it is a small two-person room, it is enough for three people.  The seafood braised monkfish is delicious, and it’s okay to mix it with the monkfish seasoning. Please note that parking is narrow and there are no guides.

The store is on the 2nd floor.

I've been going to this place for a long time, and it's the most delicious among all the monkfish stew restaurants around here. It comes with chive pancake as a side dish and it's really delicious, but the portion is a bit small so it's 4 stars.

Expecting really delicious seafood stew, I arrived at the store with difficulty and parked my car in a nearby parking lot and went straight to the store, but as expected, there were many people waiting.

After waiting for about 3 hours for my turn, I sat down, placed my order, and waited a while longer before being served delicious food full of fresh seafood. I drank so much seafood that I couldn't even remember the side dishes around me, and the pain of waiting subsided. After eating for a while, when I've finished eating all the onions and radishes on the bottom, I decide on a route and order fried rice.

I'm looking at the bottom of the pot, which has a decent amount in it, so I take it and throw it away.
It wasn't a long time, but after waiting for a while, the fried rice that looked the same as what I saw on TV came out. After pushing a little, the words to eat resonate like an echo. Sizzling, sizzling... crunchy... the timing is now.

Wow, wow, wow, it’s delicious.
1. Jeongho Restaurant in Pyeongchon has moved to near Anyang 1st Street. Since I moved to a very crowded neighborhood, parking wasn't easy. However, since it was recently moved, the interior is clean. 2. As the original Anyang Seafood Stew, there are quite a lot of customers. You can order seafood stew as a single menu, and udon noodles, fried rice, and fried rice can be ordered additionally. When you order, the food is served uncooked, and when it starts to boil, the owner prepares it for you. 3. If the broth is not enough, you can add a little more broth. Personally, I was disappointed that the taste was not exciting. This appears to be because no seasoning is used (please note personal taste).
It was a good Nambu Market restaurant, and even after moving, the seafood was fresh, not spicy, and delicious.
It's even better because it's prepared so it's easy to eat.
However, the price has risen a lot so it is a burden to go often.
Same old taste. Protected. It's a restaurant
As for the price. I'm not that nice~~
special day. I want to find it again
I found out late that the restaurant near Nambu Market has moved!
While walking around Daengridan-gil looking for a restaurant for dinner, I ended up on Jungang-ro.
I went to an off road and saw the name and thought it was there, but I was right!!
Start eating seafood first, and the more you boil it without adding seasoning, the better it tastes.
Eating rice with seafood stew is paradise haha.
I was happy to eat hot and cool soup on a cold day..ㅠㅠ

Parking is free for 1 hour in the first parking lot.
My family of four doesn't like sancho, so I asked for it to be removed, but since they were very busy, the food came out late and they added a lot of sancho.  The owner suddenly left, offering to give me the canned cider I had ordered.
We will never go again. May you prosper.

Among them, water kimchi is the best~
Steamed monkfish is the best~!!!

Staff are very attentive as well! Highly recommend!
so lets talk about banchan (korean side dishes).. lets talk about all 13 they serve here!!! not only do they give heaps of variety but the quality is definitely there too!

their main dishes here are aiight. nothing too special. their Samgyetang has the rich earthy taste however, me personally, it lacked seasoning (but maybe this is how its meant to be done like in korea?)

the highlight of this restaurant is definitely the banchan!
order one or two mains (between a group) and then feast on the banchan!
generally their serving size of mains is a decent size too!

iv been a couple times and ended up over ordering each time
Local Korean friend brought me to this place. It is said that the taste of the food here is equally good compared to how they were in Korean.

I like the Ginseng Chicken Soup. They serve 1 person portion, but I felt that it's a big portion to be consumed by just 1 person. You can order 1 person portion and share it.

The other food I like was the glass noodles with beef. Taste really good. If you are a fan of tendons, do order a plate of beef tendons. It's really soft and tender. Of course all the other kimchi were awesome as well.
I was overwhelmed by a variety of Korean banchan, again surprisingly each one is delicious. I ate japchae(korean sweet potato noddles), rice cake, kimchi pancake, fresh cabbage kimchi and so many other side dishes... I particularly ordered chungkukjang soup(fermented soybean soup, which is very stronger flavour than denjang soup) and it cooked with fresh tofu with a genuine taste. It seems very popular to local Vietnamese and expats from Asian countries but definitely it is Korean taste, not compromising. The owner and the staffs are kind and nice. They also sell fresh kimchi with variety such as radish kimchi, gatkimchi and cabbage kimchi. The location is on the 2nd floor of M plaza, same building of hard rock cafe. I feel like I will visit Myung ga Korean restaurant very soon. It is not MSG taste so I would love simple nice taste.
It is in m plaza. I came here for lunch when the whole building started to go out for lunch. Thia building has a lot of korean work here. While i was considering which korean store should I go because there are two next each other. And I saw Korean come here more than the next store so we decided to eat here.

The hotpot is huge for 3 people. The staff is really nice to let us know the portion is big for 3 girls so they also recommended us to choose better.

Nice service, nice food

So So!
I went to a Korean beef restaurant with my wife.  As a lunch special, I ordered aged radish radish kimchi (striped meat + tenderloin) for 2 servings (38,000 won x 2) for 76,000 won and seasoned ribs (1 serving) for 32,000 won, and the galbitang and mulmilmyeon were just served as a lunch special. The meat is melting, but my wife said it was expensive, so I went there. Wow.. I thought I was eating salchisal, but I won the lunch special. ㅠㅠ.. The tenderloin was a bit soft and the strip meat was a bit tough. The common characteristic of Korean beef restaurants is that they are expensive and the portions are small... I ate the galbitang to my fill.
I had seasoned ribs as a lunch special, but the meat was a bit tough despite the seasoning. So much so that I can understand why people told me to eat bulgogi...

It felt like there was a slight distinction between the galbitang customers and the meat customers, but that's business policy... Still, the soybean paste stew and cold cold noodles were delicious.

It's perfect.
It is located inside the hot springs, so the access road is not that wide, but it is not inconvenient.
First, I asked for the 45,000 won course and ate it.
What I think... In terms of the actual food, it's worse than the nearby Baekban restaurant. What did I find that was delicious? Is the flounder sashimi worth 3 or 4 points per person? Other than that, everything except the sweet and sour mushroom soup was not good. I wonder if the octopus was also made of frozen slices. If you put in a lot of effort, you get eel. It's only 1 point per person, but... I thought it was dried pollack. Still, for 45,000 won, it wouldn't have been bad if one or two things were disappointing, but everything was bad except for one or two things. Well, as you can see from the picture, other than the excellent landscaping. It seems like you are leaving knowing that you have nothing to show for it. Anyway, this is my personal opinion. It is not that the service was bad or anything like that. The food was the worst.

I went there because I heard it was a good restaurant, but since it is a good restaurant, there was a wait.
However, the wait does not take several tens of minutes and goes away quickly.
The turnover rate is good, so it's good for people waiting, but it seems like people eating inside the store eat quickly rather than leisurely.
I felt like I was subtly noticing my husband, so I ate quickly and then got up and left. 🤣
The taste was as good as it is a good restaurant.
We each ordered soft tofu and extra pork belly, but the staff was saying something, but I couldn't understand what they were saying, so we ended up getting three pieces of rice even though we were both eating.
I think you said that extra rice would be served, but I think I'll have to listen carefully in that case.

Since my first visit back in 2016, this gem of a restaurant has consistently exceeded my expectations, never failing to deliver an exceptional dining experience.

I fondly recall even visiting during Ramadan, a testament to the enduring allure of this establishment. The authenticity of the cuisine is truly unparalleled, and I find myself relishing every dish that graces our table.

If there's one thing you absolutely must try at Manaland, it's their live barbecue – an experience that tantalizes the taste buds and leaves a lasting impression.

Stepping into Manaland feels like being transported to the heart of Asia, with its unchanged ambiance that radiates pure Korean charm. This authenticity extends beyond the decor to the food itself, prepared with meticulous care by Korean hands, free from any additives or unnecessary embellishments.

Despite its culinary excellence, Manaland remains accessible to all, with prices that cater to every budget. If you share my love for Korean cuisine, a visit to Manaland is an absolute must – an opportunity to savor the true essence of Korean flavors without compromise.
Love this place. Starters are amazing (tofu is just wow). Miso soup is very good. Didn’t take pics of the eel rolls (Dragon one…) because it was so delicious. We ate it in a moment.  Food was great. Definitely will come again.
Korean food is very famous for its flavourful dishes and diverse ingredients. We were craving something harty and delicious to have for lunch, so we decided to give Mana Land Korean Reasturant a try, and we were very happy we did.

There were a lot of sides served, and they were all very tasty ( especially the pickeled cucumber ). The hot pot was very flavourful, and the meat used very tender and just melted away on our palettes.

The sauces were just a bit limited but still very well prepared.

Would highly recommend visiting this place in the future 😀 👌 😊.
Best service, food and ambiance.
Nice servers and specially the chef, he even check us personally if we are enjoying our dinner.. and yes we did ! 😊
Amazing people especially Kuya Dan.
Comfort food as always.
Miso soup THE BEST.

I enjoyed a lot!

Korean style Chinese restaurant. Try their Tangsuyuk (Sweet & Sour Pork)
This is a Chinese restaurant near Seolleung Station. Although the price is quite reasonable compared to Gangnam prices, the taste is quite good.
Although it has a slightly old-fashioned taste and cooking style, I think it is well-made. Jjajangmyeon has a well-stir-fried sauce to preserve the vegetable texture, and is moderately sweet and salty. Sweet and sour pork doesn't have a huge amount of meat like the popular style these days, but I think the ratio of meat to fried food is just right, and it's very crispy and has a clean taste.
The employees are generally friendly and the store is spacious. The interior has a slightly old-fashioned feel, but has its own charm.
Heeraedeung is a triple hit of kindness, service, and taste!

It's great to have a Chinese restaurant like this in my neighborhood!

From now on, Chinese restaurants will definitely be a hit! Highly recommended!!!

Delicious seafood
Raw raw fish is delicious, but be sure to try the fried shrimp. It's very delicious. + The yellowtail raw fish here is really fresh and chewy. It's a great restaurant!!!!! The 🐟 seasonal yellowtail 🐟 was the most delicious than the raw fish salad❤️❤️
It's a raw fish restaurant, but it's very clean and a good raw fish restaurant.
It’s plentiful and you can feel the true taste of raw fish soup.
Everything else is delicious too
The parking lot is quite large and it's in front of Tancheon after eating, so you can walk right away.
Rather than the common chojang-like taste of multan, it tastes a lot like fruit, especially kiwi. People who like the strong taste of soy sauce may be a little disappointed, but personally, I think I'll often think about it because I can comfortably drink the soup and it's not bad when rolled up with rice or noodles.

I remember saying it was unique because it had gourd in it, but it's been so long that I may not remember it accurately ^^;

Yeonpo-tang is made with live octopus from Oryukdo Island at Chungnyeolsa Seowon Market and its rich soup.
The picture is Oryukdo Octopus Yeonpotang.
The device costs 50,000 won.
The stir-fried octopus had almost the same taste, so there was nothing special about it, just the right amount of octopus and shrimp.
Naksae costs 11,000 won per person, and air rice costs 1,000 won separately.
There is a parking lot next to the store, which is convenient.
The seafood stew contents are good.
It's just spicy
Be sure to ask for it not to be spicy in advance.
Sikhye is delicious too.
No matter when you come and eat it, it always tastes the same.
The generous portion size is superb.
This is a restaurant with 29 years of tradition.
This is a house that has been advertised in various media.
The other house is small and has only a small amount.
The quantity is different in this house.
The crab is packaged and filled with the house's unique seasoning and is really delicious.

The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The food was also  served very quickly so I would recommend even if you don't have much time for lunch.
I visited 대궐안집. The restaurant's meat was fresh, so it tasted great. But, they were expensive. Waiters are friendly to customers. And the vibe was good. In the restaurant, there is a cafe. When you go there, i recommend beef. Another menu is also good.
Previous wad much better than now. quality service is soso....and price is not good.

I was really good but my sister said it is not reasonble price with common taste.

I ordered steamed codfish and cabbage pancake and enjoyed them.

International food. Nice decoration. Good service.

However, the food was nothing special. There were sushi, sashimi, steamed seafood, BBQ, grilled meat, Italian, Korean, some Chinese. I liked beef sushi, grilled beef, fried chicken, and some Korean dishes, but that's all.
I have passed the stage of buffet all you can eat but this one always deserves consideration if you have family and / or friends that are young and always hungry! The quality of the sushi and sashimi are well beyond what you can find in North American buffets and even restaurants. The thin sliced flat iron steak is very good so are the chicken wings. All cakes are Asian types with little richness and flavours compared to European ones. I am sure this place makes many people happy!
One of the best Buffets I've been so far. It  is  not possible to eat and try everything. Very good quality of the food. They put love and effort in every food they serve. I cannot put it into words. Just amazing.

You may already know Busan is the capital city for Pork Rice Soup, but Daegu has some nice places as well. If you're more into the refined taste with less pork smell, this place is not for you. However, what's the point having pork soup if it doesn't smell like pork soup? You can sense the deep smell of their soup just across the street. And I love it.

There're three ways to enjoy:
1) original taste, or a bit more soy paste and pepper.
2) spicy version: put the red pepper sauce you're given.
3) kimchi version: put the red liquid from kkakdugi(cubed radish kimchi). It's not spicy, but sweet and sour.
or combination of these three.

It's a popular place so it can be full of customers any time. If so, try other pork soup places alongside. They're all good.
Decent 돼지국밥 (pork soup with rice) in Daegu
Best of its kind in Daegu.
I ordered soup with sundae, but it came with soup with pork...
Next time, I plan to go again to eat soup with sundae.
Delicious
The store is small and has only a few tables.
I liked the old-fashioned atmosphere, so it was okay.
I went there after being recommended by a friend...
It's different from other soups.

- There was a lot of meat and it was soft.
This is an advantage
- Uniquely, soybean paste is added to the soup, but I don’t think it suits my personal taste.
There seems to be some likes and dislikes about this part.

Worst worst. It was the worst restaurant I've ever been to. It's okay to dilute the sauce for trickery. This isn't dilution. Did you fill up the used sauce container with water to wash it and then forget to replace it? The level I want to be at. The sauce in the photo is freshly scooped from the sauce container. The sauce was not mixed with the broth, but before mixing, the staff answered that it was the proper sauce.
I think the best thing is that there are a lot of ingredients for both meals, so you can choose what you want to eat! And the staff were friendly and the service was good. I like this place. Come here!!
I visited around lunchtime, but the ingredients were empty and the place where they were stored was left open to the bottom.
However, the male employee went into the kitchen and looked at his cell phone and didn't pay any attention.
I've been to many other places like Dongrae Dongrae Dongbusan Jangyu, but this is the first time I've been to a place where they don't have the variety of ingredients and the store closes. I wanted to leave after eating here.
It was okay when I went last year, so I visited again.
I don't recommend it
Before taking the order, I told them several times with a straight face, ""Don't leave food behind,"" because I was so scared that I couldn't eat the food. It's an eco-restaurant, so if you give them directions, they usually won't leave anything unless they're a clueless customer. But even before the food comes, they thought the customer would leave food and said it as if they were forcing it, so I just said it. I thought about leaving without eating. Since it is a tteokbokki restaurant, the food tastes somewhat sour, but I feel like the customer service lacks a lot of flavor.

There are side menus such as pizza/dakganjeong/pumpkin porridge/tteokbokki, and desserts such as sujeonggwa/sikhye/strawberry are also available. I thought it was a famous dakgangjeong restaurant. It's delicious. The staff are also very friendly. There is also a parking lot right in front. It may be a popular restaurant, but there is a wait on weekend evenings. However, the disappointing thing is that the seafood xiao mai (₩3,000) is served with food of unknown origin. Please avoid this at all costs.
The food is delicious, the vegetables are fresh, and there is room, so it's perfect for gatherings.
You can eat your fill of Vietnamese spring rolls. Among the salad bars, the sweet and sour pork is so delicious.
There is coffee, ice cream, cookies, rice cake, tangerine and grapefruit.
There is also sweet and sour pork, japchae, tteokbokki, tofu sushi, and kimbap.
In addition to the pumpkin salad, there were 3 other salads.
You can also add fish cake, dumpling, ramen, and rice noodle to shabu.

Starting from the 4th grade, children must order one menu item with an adult. Salad bar is 5,000 won for ages 5 to 6.
Seconds 1 2 3 are 8000 won.

The side dishes were delicious and the cutlery was individually wrapped, giving it a clean feel and convenient! Korean beef, black pork, duck, chicken, goat, etc.
They sell a wide variety of meat! After eating white boiled rice, you can order porridge. Instead of boiling the leftover boiled rice, they bring you boiled porridge. It also contains vegetables and tastes healthy. I intend to visit again🩷
Three people ordered one and a half charcoal-grilled ducks. It was cooked over charcoal so we were able to eat it comfortably, and all the side dishes were delicious.
In particular, it seemed like they made the pickles themselves, and they were seasoned just right and delicious enough that I wanted to buy them separately😊👍~The owner and staff were friendly, but since it was in the mountains, there were a lot of pregnant women.

Otoro sushi and uni on ama-ebi maki is best of best.

p.s) Must make a reservation before visiting
I've been here with my sister for omakase dinner. The restaurant is a bit far from downtown, but the distance provided such a quiet and cozy atmosphere. I was very impressed by its variety of courses and services at this price compared to what I've had in New York & New Jersey, and the quality of ingredients seems fresh.
Appetizers were personally a little sweet. Sushi, the main course, was good but was made the same way(soy sauce applied on top of sushi), thus, I couldn't find joys of the layers of flavor much.
In general, I would definitely recommend this omakase to others and take someone important for this affordable and private dinning experience.
The chef's skills are good. There were just a lot of inconvenient things about the rest.

Overall review of the dish: The cooking skills are good, but the cooking style seems to have Hongdae disease. It goes without saying that the idea of ​​mixing abalone intestines with cream cheese was truly the worst. Also, I don't know if adding lime to odeng soup is standard, but at least it's not my taste.

Steamed egg custard: The steamed egg custard itself, made from hardened katsuobushi broth, was good, but the fried glutinous rice shown in the photo was sticky and stuck to the teeth, ruining the texture.

Oden: To be honest, I don't know if this is correct because I've never tried traditional Japanese fish cake. Don’t Japanese people usually prefer chewy fish cakes? I think they added a very small amount of starch or removed it to enhance the taste of the fish, but the texture of chewing straw is amazing... To borrow Yasujiro's line, it tastes like, 'There could have been a way to add gluten.' The soup mixed with lime also tastes more like Southeast Asian cuisine than Japanese cuisine.

Overall sushi review: The quality of the rice was really good. I also liked the combination of rice and raw fish that I grabbed and combed myself. However, I don't know where I made a mistake in the raw fish, but when I thawed it incorrectly, it had a slightly sour taste that is characteristic of the dried raw fish. The taste is acceptable for supermarket sushi or low-priced sushi, but it is not a taste that can be tolerated in a sushi restaurant with high labor costs.
I'm not a cook, so I don't know the exact reason, whether it's thawing or aging that's wrong. I just felt uncomfortable the whole time I was eating because of that. That's why when the sushi dish I cooked was served, people said, 'It's delicious when cooked.'

Basic Skills: Honestly, I wish I could sharpen my basic skills a bit more.
I asked for hot green tea, but I didn't expect it to be served in a glass. A glass is usually used to drink cold drinks. The reason hot coffee is put in a mug is because heat transfer is slow. Because the person who catches it is less hot! Wasn't there another cup?

Atmosphere: The atmosphere is really nice, but could you please leave out that shitty anime beat? A Demon Slayer OST with a traditional Japanese atmosphere... (Maybe I'm sensitive because I'm a bitch)
I think it would have been better to just choose Japanese classical music.

Anyway, I am not a good person to call myself a gourmet because my knowledge about food is limited. It is just an evaluation from a casual eater who pursues cost-effectiveness and a taste that matches it, so there is no need to listen to it, but I just wrote honestly what I felt.
I think it's the best sushi omakase you can eat at this price. I visited here after hearing many people say it was great value for money. It may vary from person to person, but for me, the liver is quite mild. But I am very grateful to literally eat this course at this price. Personally, I think it would be best to just change the uni. It seems like they use Peruvian, but the bitter taste at the end is disappointing.
Do you mind if I take a little more? It's good enough to make you think:
The shari using red vinegar was really good and delicious.
The neta was in good condition so I enjoyed it.
I think I will definitely visit again next time.

I hope Suntory Gakubin will be in stock in the future.

My parents used to take us to this restaurant almost once every week for dinner decades ago. Now I have revisited few times as a grown-up. Although they have changed a lot in terms of the looks and price, I find the beef still perfectly tender and all side dishes pretty flavorful.
The restaurant now occupies the whole building with an elevator. The wait staff are not overly friendly, but they are fast and efficient in somewhat systematized ways. The table cooking is closely watched by a waitress, so the meats are cooked and served in perfect timing.
The price has definitely gone up by a lot even when compared to other restaurants in area, it might not be a place I could take my family once every week anymore.
It is voted as one of the three best Galbi BBQ restaurants in Suwon. A nice place to host guests and ambience is nice. A plenty of parking space and located on major intersection.  A lot of side dishes are offered too.

We narrowly missed lunch, arriving at 12:07pm just as the line was finishing. Determined to try once and for all, we returned at 3pmPM and were fortunate to be the first in line. By 5pm, the line had wrapped around the building.

Regrettably, despite being the first seated for dinner, the raw ribs were still sold out.
I recommend going all out and ordering as many marinated ribs as your heart desires—they taste amazing when cooked on that charcoal grill. The soybean paste stew had pieces of ribs in it and was bursting with flavor. We also ordered bulgogi and potato noodles, which soaked up the bulgogi marinade nicely. The salad and other banchan really elevated the meal. Overall, this was our favorite meal in Busan.
This was the best Korean bbq restaurant we have had during this holiday. The side dishes were more tasteful than other restaurants and the meat was unbelievable tender and tasteful, also because of specific scoring technique they apply to the beef. The service was outstanding and we will always remember this restaurant in Busan. This is really worth waiting for!
This is a popular restaurant in Busan. You have to arrive before opening to queue and join the waitlist to get a spot. It’s pricy in comparison to other galbi restaurants, but the meat is fresh and flavourful. Our highlight was the patata noodles on the grill mixed with the bulgogi sauce at the end of the meal… that’s was really tasty. We do recommend coming for the experience but it’s true that it’s a bit overly hipped.
Long wait (about 1.5 hours in the queue and we got there at 5 on the dot) but worth it for the best KBBQ short ribs we’ve ever had. Really fair pricing too. My rec: get there at 5 on the dot, add yourself to the queue, and then go nearby for a drink until you’re about 5 in line.
We had a really good memory of this restaurant ten years ago so came back for a high expectation.  After waiting for an hour and a half, we were so disappointed; the Galbi meat was too tough with too much fat, stew was too bland, rice smelled a little.  Considering how much it cost. We will not return ever.

It's been a while since I was impressed by natural taste!
The basic side dishes are okay, and the hamo shell jelly is not refillable.
(The taste was unique)
Hamohoe I couldn't taste anything. It felt like sekoshi (bone and meat together)!
The Hamo Shabu Shabu comes whole with the bones missing, and when you dip it in the broth, it blooms like a flower..🤩
It came with a special sauce, but when I dipped it in, it wasn't salty and it was delicious!!!
At the staff's recommendation, I ate porridge first and then ramen noodles.
When I made ramen, the soup went in, so when I ate the porridge later, it was a bit bland, so I set aside the soup and ate the porridge, but the staff made the first part for me first. They were kind and brought out the side dishes quickly when I requested them.
However, because the surrounding area is a bit noisy, it is difficult to call the staff 😂
It felt like I was eating a Hamo course meal, but it was properly nourishing.

The total amount
Hamohoe (small) 70,000 + Hamo shabu-shabu (medium) 110,000 + porridge 4,000 (minimum 2 people) + ramen sari 2,000 = 186,000
2020-06-25 Douglas Fir Hamo Sashimi Shabu Shabu

It might be personal preference, but
I wonder if this is a fish that Hamo would pay this price for.
Only the sauce is slightly different from the poached conger eel (hamo yubiki) eaten in Yeosu, but the broth and eating method are the same.
The prices are scary even in Yeosu, but four adults could eat one meal worth 140,000 won and finished off with Hamotang. I think this is a pretty reasonable(?) price.
The 8,000 won hamotang is a Gyeongbuk-style loach stew, cooked in a mild vegetable soup style and very delicious.
It's hard to recommend it because of the price, but you can taste delicious pike eel in Busan without having to go to Yeosu, and it's not inferior to the taste of Yeosu.
A place where you can enjoy delicious raw conger eel or shabu-shabu. The pike eel stew is also delicious. You can park right in front of the store or on the breakwater behind the store. Closed on the first and third Sundays.
However, the somewhat expensive price and unfriendly attitude of the staff are disappointing.
A place where you can eat Hamo Shabu Shabu.
It is worth eating as a delicacy in summer.
The price is a bit expensive, but I recommend it.
As of August 2017, one piece worth 100,000 won is enough to feed 2-3 people.

I took my seniors there just in time for the opening time on the weekend, and I was first satisfied with the store as it was spacious, comfortable, and clean.
I ate a set meal of 2 cutlassfish and 2 mackerel, and the meat was large and thick, and the flesh was soft and had no smell, so I was satisfied. It comes as pot rice, and I was very satisfied because I like chewy rice, but please note that people who like thick rice may not like it.

The side dishes and fried pork were delicious in their own way, but it was a shame to get refills since the store was busy.
The friendliness of the staff seems a bit off. I think it will prosper even more if sufficient improvements are made in these areas.

The wait may be a bit long during lunch hours on weekends, so please keep that in mind if you are going.
Overall, it's okay and okay
The atmosphere of the store is good
There aren't many grilled fish restaurants, but the inside of the restaurant was spacious and comfortable to eat.
A restaurant specializing in cauldron rice and fire-grilled fish.
First of all, it is convenient as there is ample parking.
In fact, it is not easy to access except for those who are not close enough to visit using public transportation.
Basically, cauldron rice for one person and mackerel and cutlassfish freshly grilled in an oven do not require any other side dishes.
The side dishes also came out nicely.
The prices have risen a lot recently, so the price is somewhat high, which is disappointing.
I came here for dinner with my family at the recommendation of my husband.

There was ample parking space and there were many families visiting.

I ordered a set meal of mackerel and cutlassfish, spicy beef stew, Damyang pork ribs with lotus leaf rice, and cauldron rice, and ate a lot.

Since it is grilled in an oven, it is less greasy and has less fishy taste, so I think it would be good for children to eat.

Pork ribs are sweet and have a very soft texture.

Lotus leaf rice contains beans, pumpkin, jujube, etc., so I, who likes sticky rice, really enjoyed eating lotus leaf rice. (It also has a scent, so I think it's the lotus leaf scent. It's my first time eating lotus leaf rice... haha)

I make rice in a cauldron with scorched rice, but my younger brother, who had been drinking yesterday, ordered beef stew and then made it with scorched rice... haha.

The downside is that the oven is inside the store, so it smells like grilled fish...
We were fine...
My younger brother, who is more sensitive to smells than us, had a bit of a hard time at the entrance to the restaurant.

Break time is from 3 to 5 o'clock.
Avoid visiting during this time!

The photo is of the Tuesday lunch special (8,000 won per person), tofu and pork jjageul for 3 people. It feels like a stew with little broth rather than a thick texture. The taste is average. I am a white rice thief. The zucchini is cut into so many different shapes that it seems insincere. It's a shame that the seasoning isn't even applied well.
This is the only place in Busan where you can taste fermented skate.
The owner’s hometown is Jeolla-do.
It's a shame that even though the skate has been soaked a lot, it hasn't been soaked that much.
If you ask for a lot of dried skate, they will give it to you.
Steamed Hongseo is also available.
They said they even make menus that don't exist.
The japchae served as a side dish is always black and salty, and the main menu is also very salty.
Personally, I like things that are salty and spicy, but this restaurant is a bit strong.
The stewed mackerel had a very fishy smell, probably because it was frozen. I was hungry, so I just ate the aged fish, but it took away the fishy smell.
How about using a secret method?
Japchae restaurant. The downside of Samhap is that the meat is a bit tough. The kimchi is a bit sour, but it tastes good when eaten with meat. I was satisfied. My companions said that the barley gulbi was absolutely delicious.
The lunch menu for each day of the week is really good~^^ I visited on Monday and had a delicious cockle bibimbap~~^^♡

It's not far from the end of the earth. There are frequent ferries every 30 minutes, so you can go leisurely or even on a day trip. It's hot, so I'll go for the long walk when the camellias are in bloom. Ah, my heart is pounding.
The location and scenery are truly unexplored. However, it feels like the region has not escaped the sanctuary of Yun Seon-do. If we want to increase his freedom and spirit, wouldn't we need a different story? Anyway, I can't think of words to describe the 360-degree scenery and rocks.
On the second day of my trip to Namdo, I went to Bogildo Island to search for Yun Seon-do's missing traces.
Bogildo, a hermitage site of Yun Seon-do, a high mountain during the Joseon Dynasty, is a place where water from the valley was drawn in, a pond was built, and Seyeonjeong pavilion was built to enjoy the natural beauty of the surrounding area.
On January 8, 2008, the name of Bogildo Island was revised to Yunseondo Garden and designated as a scenic spot.
It will be even more impressive if you stop by the exhibition hall at the entrance to the garden and read the description of Gosan's life achievements and the construction related to Seyeonjeong and look around. The guidance information is well done.

This restaurant is famous for its raw fish bibimbap. There are a lot of customers, but the turnover rate is good and the side dishes are delicious. Like Seoul Dawn House, the beef bibimbap comes with blood seed soup, and the blood seed soup is of good quality and delicious. The bibimbap is delicious, so I'm curious about the other menu items as well.
It’s a very delicious restaurant that even President YS used to frequent.
Overall, the menu has gone up in price.
Yukhoe bibimbap, which used to cost 13,000 won, now costs 15,000 won.
I think it's because prices are rising, but it seems like it's risen twice in a few months ^^
My child likes meat, so I ordered bibimbap and grilled bulgogi.
Personally, I feel like grilled bulgogi is expensive, but it is delicious.
Blood sausage soup served as a side dish is also good.
Parking is available at the tax office right next door on weekends.
Please note that there is a break time.

You can walk to Bosu-dong Bookstore Alley, so it's great for sightseeing.
I visited Saejinju Restaurant after a long time. Yukhoe Bibimbap and Seonjiguk were delicious. All the side dishes were delicious, so I ate them all^^

Staff also are super friendly, and the owner speaks great English! He was able to talk us through the menu, and also helped us cook the meat!
Highly recommended!
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Fantastic Korean BBQ restaurant. The staff were friendly and incredibly helpful. Our waiter also spoke enough English and was readily willing to use translation app to fill in any gaps.
The food was AMAZING. The meal set includes the salad bar and dessert. It was our first Korean BBQ experience and it was fantastic. We will definitely be back before we leave Busan!

Just be aware that they have a break and are closed between 4pm and 5pm.
I decided to come here based on some of the positive reviews. Sadly my experience was not the same as others. The menu has changed and priced differently, ordering is done via tablet now that has an English language option. Unfortunately the translation doesn’t give very much clarity in the details. Our server which was nice didn’t help us in cooking or how to properly eat it with the side items. They just dropped off the food and left us to do the cooking on our own. We ended up imitating what other diners were doing.
The restaurant wasn’t overly busy for a Saturday night with only 3 other tables so i was surprised at the lack of service. I would not recommend this place to first time korean bbq eaters like myself.
A very Korean-style restaurant that I went to after being introduced to it by a friend who lives in Busan!

The staff is friendly and the food is so delicious!

Perhaps because there was a hotel in front, there were a lot of foreigners in the restaurant.

I think it would also be great for foreigners looking for traditional Korean food and Korean BBQ!

If you want to feel the taste of a Korean mother's cooking, this is a restaurant I recommend as a Korean :)
You have to find the entrance via the stairs and then let yourself be welcomed by the boss, who is very friendly and speaks good English. He will explain Korean BBQ to you and help you with cooking. A very good place near the ibis hotel.
